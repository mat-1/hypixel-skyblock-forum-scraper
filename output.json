    "title": "Idea: Limit the Daily Playtime in Skyblock",
    "body": "Skyblock is a land void of happiness. It is full of despair, anger, sadness, addiction, and hopelessness. Every day, people waste hours upon hours of their lives sweating in Skyblock, desperately seeking anything that can get them further ahead in the game, even if it means hurting other people in the process.\n\nI think something seriously needs to happen to Skyblock in terms of allowed playtime in it. There\u2019s no way that it can keep going on the way it is without there being serious consequences to kids in real life. This addiction that most have to grinding is affecting their lives in really bad ways. Lots of them purposefully miss online classes just to partake in it. Increasing anger over stolen items, slowly developing depression from the absolute nothing that it brings to someone\u2019s emotional and mental health state, etc.\n\nMy proposal is to introduce a time limit per day for players when it comes to Skyblock. This is the only way that I can see any of this being fixed. Make no mistake, I\u2019m extremely aware of how unpopular this is gonna be to a lot of people. I realize that I will likely be called very bad names by several people for me even thinking to suggest this, but I think it\u2019s crucial that it be brought up.\n\n2 different 3 hour spans a day, Skyblock would be open to all players, 3 hours in the morning, and 3 hours in the evening/night time, to hopefully cater to multiple time zones across the world, and to also allow most kids to be able to play without interrupting their online classes, or in person classes.\n\nI think by introducing this limited playtime, it would turn into sort of a Grinch Simulator effect, where people can actually have fun in Skyblock, knowing that they only get a limited amount in it per day. I think the hostile atmosphere will be dramatically less, as you won\u2019t get anyone who\u2019s been in there the past 15 hours no sleep, and I think that it will shine the spotlight on more areas of Hypixel that most players probably might not be familiar with, like Turbo Cart Racers and Warlords, etc."

It makes it so that you can gain +50% stats from another selected sword. You can do this for any sword. For example, if a sword has 200 strength, and you reflect it onto the Speedy Sword, you gain +100 strength on the speedy sword until you switch the selected sword. It can be star-upgraded from metal essence, an essence that can be obtained in dungeons from Ooze (nice), the Woke Golem, in post-boss chests, or from salvaging metal-like weapons (not recommended)."

Placing saplings was an intended feature.\n\nUnlike Ghast Farming, which was macroable, this was not. It took effort to build the farm, plant, and destroy the trees. I see no reason for the admins to remove this as it is has pretty much the exactly the same effect as a Replenish enchanted hoe had on farming.\n\nBring back Sapling Placement.\n\nEdit: I'm going to try to spread this as much as possible so there's a bigger possibility admins can see.\nMy message to admins: Please consider reversing your shadow nerf on sapling placement, it harms more people than you think, it invalidates hours of effort. A nerf would be better received.\n\nEdit two: I'm going to add suggestions for nerfs here so that maybe admins will reconsider adding it!\n@Sir_Bacon_2020 suggested to keep it in the game, but nerf the exp gain.\n@Kashapo suggested to not nerf the exp, but instead make the saplings grow slower.\n@Athyestic suggested that the trees grow according to the Terraria rules, such as: \" There must be at least three open tiles between two Saplings or only one will grow into a tree. \" so that there are not as many trees."

Cuz people are always trying to max stuff, hence the whole \"grind for hours for +2 strength\" sorta thing.\nPlayers that join right now are going to miss out on stuff like the discounts at shops, which is a huge problem. \nI propose one of two options:\n1. Add a \"magical time table\" where you can contribute to past projects for a slightly increased cost (say like x1.2 price)\n2. After every building gets upgraded once, the 2nd upgrade to each building has the SAME bonuses as the first, and people who already did upgrades will already have their contributions. It just gives people who didnt contribute a chance to catch up. (This might be a problem where people who already contributed wouldn't help anymore, so maybe add a workaround)"

At the end of the day, it is extremely hard to prove someone irls, so please stop accusing people of it."

    "title": "[IDEA] Trading History, Deep Caverns revamp and more: 4000 words, 35+ positive reactions!",
    "body": "hi\n\n\nSpoiler: The Ancient Dragon (Quest): ~9800 symbols!\n\n\n\nMost of the Skyblock quests are pretty boring for me, and honestly, they can be way better. The point of this idea is to make major quests that are fun and balanced between mid-game and end-game players. I don't know about you, but i don't think you will have more fun oneshotting everyone in sight to finish the quest. Alright, i'm done with this. Now the idea.\n\nPart 1: Sub-Area \"Heart of the Mountain\"\nThe Heart of the Mountain is a parkour challenge accessible by going through a hidden entrance in the back of the Mountain. Upon entering it, all your stats will drop to the basics and items like Grappling Hook won't be usable. That's made so that you can't cheese it with Rabbit 6, Jump Boost 8 and Young Dragon Armor. The challenge consists of 3 parts: The caves, the underground and the core. When clearing a part, you will gain a fast travel option to where you are. That works pretty much like checkpoints. I tried my best to design the parts so that even people not used to parkour will be able to pass them, but parkour masters will go it way faster, which is fully deserved. Not like you can learn to parkour in a day.\n\nPart 1.1: The three parts\nThe three parts are very different in design, difficulty and other stuff. Here's the basics of how they look: the caves are made in mostly gray and black colors, with pretty easy parkour. The hardest jumps are a few neos, which, well, aren't even hard. The underground adds a bit of red and orange design to show you're getting closer to the core, and the parkour becomes significantly harder. It starts with a double neo, has a few neups on the way, not that bad but much harder than the caves. The core is the final challenge. Even harder than the underground, consists mostly of red and orange colors with lava flowing. There's still gray, but just a bit of it. The red and orange colors take up about 70% of the core. The parkour, too, gets harder. Although the core is by far the shortest one of the 3 parts, the jumps are really hard. Starting with a double neo, having a few neos in the way and ending with a neup after a few 4 block jumps, the core can take quite a lot of time. The area should be passed within 1hour by people average at parkour, 3 hours by people bad at it, and about 30 minutes by people really good at parkour.\n\nPart 1.2: The parkour rewards\nThe parkour isn't easy, so the rewards have to be pretty good. There are 4 things you get for completing the course, and there they are: The Mountain Core looks like a red firework core and is used in the crafting recipe for the Mountain Heart: The core in the middle, surrounded by 8 stacks of enchanted cobblestone. The Mountain Heart is an Epic accessory that grants 5 Strength, 5 Crit Chance, 10 Health and 5 Defense. The second thing is simple. 6 Fairy souls. If i'm not wrong, there are currently 209 available fairy souls in the game so these will give you 2 more possible stat boosts. Pretty solid. The third one is the main thing here, the Unstable Portal. It's a gateway to the major quest \"The Ancient Dragon\".\n\nPart 2: The Ancient Dragon quest - Story\nA long time ago, there was a clan on the territory which later becomes the place for the Village to be. Over time, it fell and only one person was still living there, Old Adventurer. Everyone else left the clan searching for better places to live. Recently, a powerful creature decided to live nearby the Old Adventurer: the Pure Dragon. Luckily, it didn't notice the old adventurer at first so he had time to hide. Living in a cave, he's safe from the dragon, but he can't really go anywhere now. There's only a little area where the dragon can't hear or see him, which became the farm he's using to provide himself with food. He managed to see how strong and merciless the dragon is, and decided to just wait in the cave until the dragon leaves the place forever. That's not happening anytime soon...\n\nPart 3: The Ancient Dragon quest - Action\nWhen you warp in through the portal, instead of warping it to the overworld (like the signs suggest) the portal warps you back in time. All your items are lost and the pure dragon is gone on a hunt. You can still go back by simply using the SB menu, and your items will be alright in the normal time. The old adventurer knows when the dragon usually comes back, and doesn't risk coming out. The dragon, obviously, only arrives once you find the place. Hints are thrown around the place showing where he is, so this shouldn't be a big problem. Once you find the Old Adventurer, you can talk to him and he will give you an old helmet, an old bow and an old sword and a map to protect yourself just in case if something goes terribly wrong. The entrance closes, so now you're stuck with him. When talking to him again, he will provide various hints that you have to find a secret passage through the wall that even he never knew about. That passage can provide a safe exit out of the village, but now the old adventurer doesn't want to leave so much. Instead, he's thinking about having revenge on the dragon since he has someone to help now. Now, the main action starts. You can collect Iron hidden around the place by going through the secret passage. There's a total of 18 Iron hidden around the map, not all of which is accessible instantly. It's used to upgrade your gear: The old helmet only has 50 HP and 50 DEF, but each stat goes up by 25 when its upgraded. Upgrades 1/2/3/ cost 1/2/3 iron respectively. The bow and sword work the same: 50 DMG and STR to start off, +25 to each stat when upgraded. the upgraded versions are called: Old, Recovered, Polished and Perfect.\nThe quest goal is to fight the Pure Dragon multiple times, each time he will go away. After fighting him for the first time by going to the top of the mountain when he's on a hunt (1:00 to 2:00 AM skyblock time) and waiting until he comes back, the map will start showing the new location of the dragon. Further fights are more simple, just come close to him and the fight starts. As he flies further, more areas and therefore more Iron is accessible. In a total of 4 fights, he goes from Home -> Forest -> Floating Islands (Jungles) -> The End. At each battle, the dragon has 10,000/20,000/30,000/100,000 HP respectively. More iron is unlocked too, with a total of 2 iron being available at the start and 3/6/9 iron being unlocked with each battle respectively. At the battle in The End, although the dragon has 100,000 HP, the Old Adventurer will instantly kill (supposedly finish) him once you've dealt 40,000 HP damage. That's a special cutscene, in which he jumps in from above and uses the Pure Chains to lock himself inside the egg in the middle of the Dragon's Nest, where the fight is happening too. As hunderds of years pass we're back in the current times, the Pure Dragon eventually dies and dissapears into the air, however out of the dust left by him, another dragon is born and starts growing... the only way to free him from the egg is by placing 12 Summoning Eyes into the altar below. Also, speaking of Pure Chains. That's an item found in a cave at the very top of the mountain, the area that unlocks when defeating the dragon for the second time. The item is required to make bridges from island to island, as there are no portals. The old adventurer gives a hint on where the Pure Chains are, saying \"I don't think we can follow the dragon to the Floating Islands... There was a storage in our clan before, but the dragon took it to where he lived before you came. There's probably nothing left, but maybe you can check it?\". When you climb, there's only gonna be the chain on top. Give it to the old adventurer, and he will say \"The chains are different from what i remember. Not sure if that's a good thing anyway.\" and take the chains. That's pretty much it.\n\nPart 4: Rewards\nI'm writing this a bit later than the eariler parts and i'm sorry if something doesn't match with what i said before.\nTo the rewards. The quest itself is really long and big, so the rewards are huge as well.\nThe first reward is Pure Scale and it's a drop from the final Pure Dragon bossfight. It's one of the two items that can be transfered from the past to the normal skyblock world. If your inventory is full as you get in the normal world with a Pure Scale, it will be in your stash. So, what does it do? You can combine it with a Summoning Eye in a crafting table to get an Awakened Eye. Then, you can place the A. Eye in one single middle frame of the altar. Once it's placed, the Pure Dragon will appear. It has 15M health and can use all of the attacks used by normal dragons. For the single person who placed the eye, it will always drop 2 or 3 Pure fragments to the person who placed it and 3-4 random fragments to people who simply damaged it. The chances of getting a specific type of a fragment are the same as getting a specific type of a dragon (4% for Superior and 16% for everything else). Out of the Pure fragments, the Pure Dragon armor can be made using the classic dragon armor recipe. The PD armor has the stats of Unstable with 100 more defense for each piece, HOWEVER its full set bonus grants you all of the dragon armor effects expect for the Superior and Holy effects, their bonuses are nerfed to 1.7% regen speed and 3% stat boosts. I'm honestly not sure about this one, it should probably be buffed and nerfed a lot of times.\nThe second reward, as if the PD armor wasn't enough, is an epic accessory called \"A Relic from the Past\". the Old Adventurer will give you the accessory after defeating the PD for the last time as a gift. It's also one of the two items that can be transfered to the normal world. The effect is pretty simple: All the reforges applied have their negative effects removed, and the positive effects are buffed by 1.5%.\n\nPart 5: Afterwords\nHonestly, i think this area can be used for more quests or bossfights. Not sure about that though.\nI've spent a few days working on this, and the only problems i currently see with this is the quest being so large it can't be added because of that.\nIf you have any ideas to improve this one, please tell them in the replies! Bumps are always appreciated, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Trading History (Menu option): ~3000 symbols!\n\n\n\nThis idea is basically what the name suggests. It's pretty simple, but i'm gonna try to explain this in details.\nThe trading history option is located in the top left corner of the menu and looks like a diamond.\n\nPart 1: Design\nThe sides are covered with black glass panels, as a lot of other menu parts in Skyblock. The history itself is shown in a lot of heads sorted by whatever you want it to be sorted by. The options are Newest first, oldest first and biggest first (amount of different items in trade). When you hover over a head, it shows what the trade was like. Example below:\n\n\nSpoiler: Trade details\n\n\n\nTrade with Player\n+100,000 coins\n-Leather Boots (Colored: #9300D3)\nTrade completed: September 11, 2001\nID: ba23-jA3-nNMj6y\n\n\nNotice that \"ID\" part in trade details? It's made to look up trades. At the top right part of the history, there's a \"Find trades\" sign. Click on it, and a sign will show up in which you can type in a trade ID which you probably got from your friend or a scam rage thread. The ID will also show in the bottom of the chat message after completing a trade. Also, it's possible to disable the possibility to look up your trades or in the API settings (or set it to semi-private like \"friends only\").\n\nPart 2: Trade settings\nTrade settings is a mini option located in the top left corner of the history and seen as redstone dust. The option is pretty much what the name suggest, but like everything here, i'm gonna try to explain it in details. Here's a list of things you can change:\n\n\nSpoiler: Possible options in settings\n\n\n\n-Trade confirmation time: No confirmation, 3s (classic), 5s, 10s\n-Auto-stack items added into trade: Yes, no (classic)\n-Blacklist players from trading with you: (add players manually)\n-Reset sent items to their normal forms (e.g dyed leather armor becomes undyed, and changed name to \"Leather Boots (Colored #9300D3)\"): Yes, no\nand more i didn't think of\n\n\n\nPart 3: Counter-trading?\nI'm really not sure about this one. It can be easily bad, but i'm still gonna put this here.\nClicking on a head in the history allows to send them a counter-trade, even if they're not online. In it, you can choose things from both yours and theirs inventory. They can accept it by seeing a message about a trade being sent in their chat and then accepting/declining by doing the same thing as you did to send. If they were offline when you sent the counter-trade, the message will appear as soon as they join Skyblock. I'm not sure about this at all because offline trading is something absolutely new and is not how trades work and were working since the release of SB.\n\nPart 4: Afterwords\nThis idea is fairly simple and short.\nI see it being useful for sending proofs that you've been scammed primarly, but there's so much more ways this can be used.\nThis one, too, is pretty incomplete. I feel like a lot more can be added to this one, so please tell your suggestions in replies if you want to.\nAgain, bumps are always appreciated. Thank you for reading!\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Deep Caverns Revamp (Revamp): ~9000 symbols!\n\n\n\nThe deep caverns, are, well... deep caverns. You're leaving this area extremely early and probably not coming back expect for getting fairy souls. This revamp should make the Deep Caverns more useful to mid-game and late-game players.\n\nPart 1: Sub-Area: \"The Abyss\"\nThe name probably isn't very original. Maybe i'll change it later.\nThe Abyss is the deepest area accessible in the deep caverns, and is not accessible like the other areas by simply going down or using the lift. None of these will work with The Abyss. Instead, you must find a deep hole in the Obsidian Sanctuary and drop down in the horizontal portal you can't see. There's no level requirement to get down there, but only a small area with monsters as strong as the Obsidian Sanctuary ones can be explored. The rest is blocked by the Lift Operator saying \"You're still very weak to go there... Just like myself. Maybe you should come back when your Combat skill reaches 15? Once you're strong enough, i'll let you pass.\". As you can see from the dialogue, you need Combat 15 to explore the rest of the Abyss because of the strong mobes on the other side. Also, forgot to mention. The Abyss, unlike other Deep Caverns sub-areas, doesn't go down. Instead, it goes to the all the sides and just a little bit up (about 15 blocks difference from the lowest and highest points).\n\nPart 1.1: Monsters of the Abyss\nThe monsters are, well, strong. You already know that anyways. I'll just list the mobs here.\n\nLiving Void: Zombie with 25,000 health. Has leather armor dyed black. The classic monster in the Abyss, met fairy often.\nPalace Guard: Skeleton with 35,000 health. Just like Living Void, has black leather armor. You start noticing them as you go to the right, where the Gray Palace is located. They start appearing rarely, but as you go closer to the Gray Palace, they will be appearing more often.\nOld Guard: Zombie with 40,000 health. Has iron armor. As you walk into the Gray Palace, Palace Guards are replaced by Old Guards. which move 20% faster than the easier mobs in the Abyss.\nTo the mob drops. Living Void drops from 2 to 10 Rotten Flesh, as well as Enchanted Obsidian with a 5% chance.\nPalace Guards drop from 2 to 10 bones, as well as a random piece of Golem Armor with a 1% chance.\nOld Guards drop from 5 to 15 Rotten Flesh, as well as an Empty Artifact with a 1% chance.\nEmpty Artifact can be used at the Altar in the Gray Palace to speed up the time left until Intelligent Emptiness spawns by 20 minutes. Also, speaking of Intelligent Emptiness...\n\nPart 1.2: Intelligent Emptiness\nIntelligent Emptiness is the boss in the Abyss, an ender dragon. It spawns every 2 hours in the Gray Palace. When it spawns, all the Old Guards will despawn. The boss has 20M HP, which is quite a lot. And it becomes even more, because all the damage higher than 125,000 only deals 100,000.\nThe attacks, unlike others, deal a % of your current HP instead of an amount of damage. The attacks are: Rush - The boss rushes at a random player, dealing 40% of your their health. Meteor - A warning comes in chat. 3 seconds after, a meteor falls on every player from the sky dealing 25% of their max health. Meteors fall slowly, so you have time to avoid them. Rage - Activates at 50% health and lasts for the rests of the fight. Meteors fall 25% faster and rush deals 50% of a player's current health instead of 40%. Call - A lot of Living Void starts spawning right outside of the bossfight room and come towards the players. Call happens at 25% health and lasts for 10 seconds spawning 2 LV per second, for a total of 20 Living Voids. Final Blow - The Intelligent Emptiness blows up 5 seconds after death, instakilling everyone who came in range. This attack is very unlikely to hurt anyone, as death will probably happen high up in the air.\nThe drops are pretty decent. The I.E always drops 1-50 obsidian, 1-10 ench. obsidian and 1-3 \"Parts of Emptiness\". RNG drops, of course, exist. Did you think we're not in skyblock? The boss drops a random piece of Void Armor with a 5% chance, or 20% chance for those who got in the Top 3 of damage leaderboards shown at the end of the battle. All the Void Armor pieces have the same stats:\n\nPart 1.3: Void Armor statistics\nVoid Armor is leather armor dyed gray. The statistics are:\nOne Piece | Full Set\n+210 Health | 840 Health\n+120 Defense |480 Defense\n+20 Strength | 80 Strength\n+5 Speed | 20 Speed\n+2 Crit Chance | 8 Crit Chance\nIt also has a neat Full Set Bonus: Void Creature - This set of armor makes you a shade, making mobs notice you only when you're 2.8 blocks near them. Hitting a mob with a sword when invisible deals 50% more damage, but only works once on a single monster. Once the ability is used up, the same monster will see you in their normal range.\n\nPart 1.4: The Abyss design\nThe Abyss is made mostly in gray and light gray colors, with a bit of black. There's no ceiling in this area, and all the action happens on small islands located about 2 blocks between each other. Falling in between small islands causes death. The Gray Palace, however, is made in 50/50 white and gray colors, with pillars and more. It has a few large rooms, and a huge throne room. Above the big throne, the Intelligent Emptiness spawns every 2 hours. Behind the throne, there's a small altar in which Empty Artifacts can be thrown to speed up the wait by 20 minutes.\n\nPart 1.5: The Abyss ores\nAs i was writing this, i kinda forgot the Abyss is still in the Deep Caverns which is a mining area. So, well. I guess i'll just put it here now.\nThere are all types of ores in the abyss. Like, every single ore. They appear on the small islands, in the floor or sometimes below it. Ores there require the Telekinesis enchant to get. Also, they have a 3% chance to give their enchanted form, and a 0.005% chance to drop their enchanted block form. Quartz can also be found in the Abyss. Yes, i do know about BouncySeal's \"The Void\" thread. Yes, i know it's similar.\n\nPart 2: The Late-Game Expansion\nEveryone knows how useless Deep Caverns are for late-game players. This part is about making the Deep Caverns something a late-game player will go into. So, let's start with the ores. One of the main purposes Deep Caverns have is getting 50 ores for a minion, which makes you completely forget about the Deep Caverns. That's one of the main things why nobody goes here, this place is literally useless because of how slowly it provides materials. How to fix that? As you progress, you unlock more features. The Mining skill is one of the main things Deep Caverns would use to see that.\nAt Mining 15, the ores will now have a 1/50 chance to give their enchanted form.\nAt Mining 25, the ores will have a 1/150 chance to drop their enchanted block form.\nAt Mining 30, more areas will be available. I'll get to that in detail a bit later.\nFinally, at mining 40, something very interesting happens... I'll get to that later.\n\nPart 2.1: New NPC: \"Masterful Miner\"\nThe Masterful Miner is a new NPC found near the main stairs leading to the Deep Caverns. He is mainly used to provide rewards for achievements in mining. Here's a list of rewards:\nMining 10: 5 Enchanted Diamonds\nMining 15: \"Magical Blade\" Enchantment Book recipe\n\n\nSpoiler: \"Magical Blade\" Pickaxe enchantment\n\n\n\nMagical Blade can only be crafted, you can't find it at the Enchanting Table. Its recipe is simple: 1 Ench. Diamonds at each corner (total of 4), 4 enchanted gold at each side (total of 16) and a book in the middle. Magical Blade I gives a bonus 0.4% chance to mine up an enchanted form of an ore. Each level grants a bonus 0.4%, resulting in a maximum 2% bonus chance with Magical Blade V.\n\n\nMining 20: 750,000 coins\nMining 30: 1M coins, Access to hidden areas\nMining 35: 1M coins, \"Pure\" reforge stone\n\n\nSpoiler: \"Clean\" Pickaxe Reforge\n\n\n\nClean is a reforge for pickaxes, granting 5 Defense. It also has a reforge bonus: Get a 10% chance to get triple ore drops. This also applies to enchanted block drops, giving you 3 enchanted blocks with an extremely low chance.\n\n\nMining 40: 5M coins, access to more hidden areas\n\nPart 2.2: Hidden areas\nThere are hidden areas in every Deep Caverns level. They aren't a\u0441tually \"hidden\", instead, they're only accessible with the Lift Operator once you gain permission from the Masterful Miner. The ones accessible from Mining 30 contain: Huge amount of ores, stronger mobs dropping the enchanted version of what the normal mobs of their type dropped (Sronger Lapis Zombies have 5000 Health and drop enchanted rotten flesh, stronger slimes have 2000 to 7000 health and drop enchanted slime). The hidden areas accessible from Mining 40 contain: stronger mobs; even more ores; block versions of normal ores (these also drop their enchanted block versions 20% more often than normal ores), enchanted ores (these ores also drop a random amount of coins when mined, between 1000 and 15000).\n\nPart 3: Afterwords\nWhew, that was a long one. Hope you liked it.\nHonestly, i feel like that's the worst one out of the three. As always, if you have any ideas to improve this one, please do write them in replies.\nAnd yet again, bumps are always appreciated! I spent so much time on this thread...\n\n\n\nFinally, it's done. I will be adding more ideas in future updates, i really like torturing myself i guess. Please do bump this or i will do it myself. It will take me a long amount of time to accept that this thread died. Also, i'm not really good at making ideas honestly. This might be bad.\nI really need feedback for this one, so please take your time to select one part and read it. Again, i really need feedback. I've spent a lot of time on this and i really want to see how did it turn out. Bumps are highly appreciated, too."

    "title": "[IDEA] A New Talisman For More Inventory Managment!",
    "body": "Hi! So, recently I had an idea for a new talisman that will automatically delete an item or items from your inventory. I know people have probably mentioned this before, but I think my idea will be original.\n\nThis new talisman comes in 3 tiers, (Just like the personal compacter) It will have the Vacuum Cleaner the uncommon version, the Vacuum Cleanser, the rare version, and the Vacuum Purifier, the Epic version. Here are some screenshots of each one. (Ignore the redstone tag)\nI didn't include this in the screenshots but each version of the talisman is a Hopper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are these items made?\nSo, I was thinking that this item could be made with something that can be obtained through a mob in f9, or from a chest after slaying Storm.\nThis new item would just be called Wind.\nWind would be used in each crafting recipe for each tier. Here are some screenshots of the recipes and a screenshot of the new Wind item. (The iron amount can be modified)\nP.s. I know some of my screenshots are kinda messed up right now, but this is my first idea thread, so please bare with me. (Just pretend there's a hopper in the crafting slot.)\n\nThe new Wind item. (Ignore the Materials tag)\n\n\n\n\nAnd now here are the recipes.\nThe Vacuum Cleaner Recipe. ( 160 enchanted iron and one Wind.)\n\n\n\n\nThe Vacuum Cleanser Recipe. (5 enchanted iron blocks, 1 Wind, and 1 Vacuum Cleaner.)\n\n\n\n\nThe Vacuum Purifier Recipe. ( 15 enchanted iron blocks, 1 Wind, and 1 Vacuum Cleanser.)\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it work?\nSo, I haven't really explained how this works yet. This item will be like the Personal Compacter. The Uncommon version will have one slot for the item you want to be automatically deleted, the Rare version will have 3, and the Epic version will have 5. This talisman will delete an item automatically from your inventory if you have it selected in the talisman configuration. This idea came to my head when I was foraging on my island with the new tree farm you can make. I was often having to deal with saplings and apples in my inventory because they had the habit of not stacking, and would just fill up my inventory. With this new talisman, you'd be able to just have those get sold directly to the npc for their normal price. If you put an item that can be sold to bazaar in the talisman, it will be sold to the bazaar when deleted from your inventory.\nSwords, armor, accessories, tools, and other things like that can not be put in the talisman configuration. You can only put things in that can be sold to the bazaar, or blocks that can not be sold to the bazaar but will be sold to the npc.\n\nWill this have any dupe glitches?\nThis should not have dupe glitches, as it will use the same function for putting items in the configuration as the Personal Compacter. And there have been no dupe glitches with the Personal Compacter.\n\nUnfortunately, this would not be released till the floor 9 update if admins thought it was a good item, as it requires a new item from floor 9 to craft it.\nBut it kinda makes sense to introduce a new Vacuum talisman with a boss called Storm.\n\nPlease tell me if you think anything should be modified in this!\n(Edit: With items that can be sold at bazaar, I think that they would just go through an instant sell, and not a sell offer. I think that'd break the game a bit, if you and 10000 other people were making a sell offer every 5 seconds.)"

    "body": "Hello, as you may know menacing banana is a youtuber that makes hypixel skyblock related content, and in this post i will be going over WHY he shouldn't be overly hated for the things that he had done. Now we need to know HE SHOULDN'T BE LOOKED AT LIKE AN ANGEL. HE DID WRONG AND HE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIS \"CRIMES\" Anyway let's talk about the first problem.\n\n1 . People overly insulting him for his crimes.\n\nOne of the most popular skyblock youtubers called akinsoft made a youtube video with him explaining why menacing banana is a total bag of rice stealing people's ideas, scamming partners etc. Now he is about 50% right in his video, HE DID OVERREACT TO SOME OF THE THINGS HE HAS DONE.\nAnd the hate he has gotten from the skyblock community\nis awful. For example he already got doxxed. YES, DOXXED which is an actual crime. And, he did apologize to the people he scammed the money from GAVE IT BACK, and lego maestro's newest post was this :\n\n\" Just had a very emotional interview with Menacing Banana, he broke down and was sorry about what he did.\"\n\nReally, people who overly want to hurt him should know that he, menacing banana. Is an actual human being that actually could kill himself, in his discord he told me that he had an actual panic attack so please do not send him more hate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The agroMC situation\n\nMenacing banana actually bodyshamed a youtuber called agroMc and told him that his channel was dead in a private discord call.\nHe acted like a total manchild and wasn't a nice person to be around, and well. That's a really bad thing. Still the hate is too much. But you shouldn't consider menacing as a total angel because he is not one himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The PvpWars Drama\n\nMenacing banana actually scammed his partners a few months ago, it was a bad move that he did, he got bored with that server and didn't record the 2 more videos he promised he would, now let's talk about his actual apologize for his behavour.\n\nIn his newest video he wrote a comment under with his apology and sent a tweet on twitter, which was a good thing that he did, now for the 2nd time or even 3rd time. He did return the money, and it wasn't actually 5000 dollars, it was 2000 dollars and akinsoft actually faked that one.\nThe owners of the network said they were fine because he returned the money and the issue was resolved\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitLonger \u2014 When you talk too much for Twitter\n\n\nTwitLonger is the easy way to post more than 140 characters to Twitter\n\n\n\n\nwww.twitlonger.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, please don't be a dick and hate on him, but yes he understand why people hate on him and listen, he is trying to actually fix his behaviour\nand now, is in one of the worst spots to be in.\n\n\n https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1325526662054862850\n\n https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1325526659139858438\n\ngoodbye, if you found this useful you may actually give me a reaction or something, but i don't want to farm them with my post. Because it would be a bad thing, right? If you have anymore questions feel free to actually message me here, i'll be active (probably)"

    "body": "It's bad by not having a set amount of resources collected, just like the Halloween even, to reach bronze, silver or gold level. Let me explain why:\n\nStarting out with the new update, all buffs you can have are 100% triple crops(300%) but only if you're farming 50, a hoe with Harvesting 5 which grants 62.5% and a legendary elephant pet for +50% = 412.5%. And how likely is it to be farming 50 and own a leg. elephant? Not really as someone who doesn't play 24/7.\n\nThis puts you in a disadvantage with people who already have the new hoes/axes for more crop drops. They have an easier time to get to gold than you do. This will also help them get every hoe to the 3rd tier and receive +50% for their respective crops.\nThe rich get richer and the poor get poorer."

You must have some serious brain damage if you think fish minions make you stonks?\". Nowhere in that sentence am I discriminating against a certain group of people. And before people say it's the part where I say he/she has brain damage, I am not discriminating against people with brain damage. Nowhere in that sentence do I say that people with brain damage are babies or something, I'm saying that the person must have brain damage.\nA bit of context: Some guy posted a thread where he was asking why people thought that fishing minions were bad. I responded saying that fishing minions with no super compactors fill up too quickly, and that person couldn't get on every 3 hours to collect their minions, so fishing minions would suck for money. This person then continues to say that from his \"experience\" tier 4 fishing minions make more than tier 5 lapis minions. That's kinda the reason I got so mad, he legit wan't listening to anything anyone said.\nIf any mods read this post, I think that a lot of the \"discrimination\" bans are not actually real. I have heard and seen screenshots of people getting banned for \"discrimination\" for really dumb reasons. In my case, i'm assuming that the mod just saw the words \"brain damage\" and banned me for discrimination. I'm not trying to say that the Hypixel forums mods are terrible, but they definitely need to read posts a bit clearer so these dumb bans don't keep happening.\n\ntl;dr: \"discrimination\" bans on the forums are very random a lot of the time, and mods need to read our posts more carefully.\n\nSkyblock related: While I was banned, I decided to continue my scammer thread, where I try and dumb scammers.\nSo the one I did this time was a MVP+ with endgame gear, and this kinda surprised me, I don't think anyone would be dumb enough to try to scam people and risk losing billions of coins and IRL money. The even dumber part was that he only tried to scam me out of 1.5 mil, which he could probably make in 1 hour. So I ask in the hubs for someone selling a hoe of greater tilling and I get partied by this person. I check his sky.lea.moe and his api is on, but then I refresh the website and than its off. I already knew it was a scam because I had seen the diamond hoe in his inventory that he was gonna use to scam me. Then he does the backpack scam, leaves the party, and ignore adds me.\nThis is one of the dumbest scammers I have ever met. The fact that an MVP+ endgame player is trying to scam 1.5 mil from me. He is legit risking a bunch of coins and IRL money to get 1.5 mil.\nFirst Scammer Test: https://hypixel.net/threads/poll-scam-trials-1.3408881/\nTell me if you want me to continue doing this, and any scammers you want me to test.\n\nEdit: Please actually read my post, people keep saying i'm \"ban evading\" or my \"scam reports won't go through\" even though that wasn't the point of this post."

    "title": "Inflation 2.0 ?",
    "body": "One of the main reason that inflation happen is minion, as it generate stuff over time and selling it to npc gives more coin to the economy, thus inflation(just an example), with the new farming contest update, it encourage people to actively harvest their large scale farm, generating many item at a rate much faster then before. with price of E pumpkin drop below 640(npc sell price) player is more likely to sell their crops to npc. A silver medal(from my past 3 contest) is about minimum 32k pumpkin harvested , that is about 128k coin added per person, not to mention that gold medal is about 81k pumpkin harvested, which is 324k per person. assuming only 5k of the player join each pumpkin contest and each person only earn the lowest of their rank and on average 7 pumpkin contest were held. That is an addition 1.967 Billion coin added per day just with by pumpkin contest, about 70% of daily snow and cyan minion and number is very likely to be higher as many player harvested much more pumpkin in between ranks. what do u guys think?

It's only 50k! I can get that in 2 minutes! How will that help them???\" \nto my response, I say yes, some endgame players sure can get that much money or even more in 2 minutes. But, I didn't do this \"experiment\" to just help out random people, I wanted to see how much of the early game community cared about others. \n\nAnd so, the Tl;dr is there are still kind people out there and are very grateful you are helping them.

So wonderfull in fact that I think that the creators of skyblock should take inspiration from some of the AMAZING ideas the creators of fortnite have had. This is one of my best suggestions and possibly could make it in the game with a good amount of tweaking. I noticed that fortnite added this amazing dog skin\n\n\n\n\nI believe that something similar to this can be added in skyblock. Currently there is a dog armor set but there are not nearly enough furries in the game. This means that the furry community is not represented well. I also see that soviet aspects of the game are not flaunted enough and that there should be more soviet aspects. For this, I suggest a new npc with challenges:\nSoviet doge npc (embrace the furry side)\n\nThis npc would have 3 challenges and reward you with a furry talismen that covers your screen in furries once every 3 minutes. Here are the three challenges\n\nLapdog:\nDonate 40m to a youtuber mod or helper without anything in return\n\n\nFollower\nFollow a player withing 3 blocks for 1 hour\n\n\nSocialism\nGive 15 begging nons exactly what they ask.\n\nI think that I should get creative mind for this.

I'm concerned if sentences like the skill average one isn't a dead giveaway something is a joke to you.\n\nIts all just grinding. Who tf wants to spend hours of their life on this game. This game is a waste of time. Look at wynncraft, you don't have to grind at all, you just enjoy it. This is what skyblock should be. Anyone with a skill average past 10 is a no life with no friends who probably fails all their classes, probably gonna be lonely forever. Stop playing this game and find something better to do."

    "body": "I want to first specify that this is specifically 1.17. Supposedly, the combat system changed back or something idk if not then ignore me cos 1.8 combat mechanics are wayyy better for skyblock. \n\n\nObviously server stability is gonna play a huge part in hypixel updating versions in general. It's just easier for Hypixel to run on 1.8 (I think it's on 1.8.2), they didn't change to 1.9 to keep the more competetive side of pvp and they have run that way for ages. But 1.17 might actually be good\n\nLoads of new blocks to build new islands and **** with. New mobs, netherite could be used for sets. If the combat systems are the same, the only reasons i see not to update are this:\n\nPeople like and are used to playing on 1.8\nServer stability\n\nBut yeh, I'm sure a lot of people will know more about this then me and will probably make me look dumb but if not then it could potentially be converted to 1.17?"

I dont know the names of the channels or servers, its been a while.\n\nAny user may use real money to buy skyblock gems on the hypixel store, currently $4.99 for 675 gems (which I purchased about 2 hours ago) as the lowest priced and least economical option.\n\nAny item bought with skyblock gems can be traded for in game coins, excluding those that are direct buffs to the player rather than through the consumption of an item. I discovered this after opening the bazaar before writing this and seeing 2.2mil appearing in quick sell, and wondering how 5 stacks of enchanted birch could be sold for that much.\n\nWhat do I make of this?\n\nHonestly, I feel let down by hypixel. They've been amazingly vigilant about trading various in-game items and currency for real money, and I respect that. However now it seems that they're doing it themselves. For the price of 25 bucks, you can get yourself a pigman sword and a set of superior if you target the auction house right. And if you don't, well you can eat a month of booster cookies, collect all your bits, buy stonks, and resell them with compacting X enchants on them, again raking in a decent price and boosting your XP. Not to mention the several hundred enchanted items you could sell. Way less than straight selling the cookies, but you're still opened up to the potential of in-game currency as a result of spending real money.\nI'd like to see something put in place to change this. I think that non-paying players should absolutely be able to access booster cookies in exchange for in-game effort, but maybe we should implement some way to get gems for free that doesn't involve near impossibility (if there is let me know)."

    "body": "Skyblock Stock Brokers\nThe BEST tool to making millions of coins on the bazaar WITHOUT ANY EFFORT\nOVER 2000 POSITIVE REVIEWS\n\n\nWe've done it. We hit an outstanding 10000+ members in just one week. For those not familiar with our bots, I have designed a set of a couple discord bots that track the bazaar 24/7. These bots watch crashes, crafts, flips, and use complicated algorithms to give you the best investments to do so you can make millions of coins, even without any prior bazaar flipping knowledge. Details about the bots are below.\n\n\n\nARE THESE BOTS EVEN LEGAL?\nYes, these bots are completely legal. I use the API provided by Hypixel themselves to do analysis on the bazaar. Since there\nare no ingame modifications, there is no danger of trouble using these bots.\n\n\nSpoiler: MINIKLOON APPROVED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd without further ado, let me introduce the bots that will be making you rich\n\nPERSONAL BAZAAR BOT:\n\nTruly my ultimate pride and joy, you simply input the amount of money you want to put into the bazaar, and it comes up with your own PERSONALIZED investment strategy on how to make the most amount of profit from your capital. This bot requires no thinking whatsoever, and you can rest easy knowing the strategy that it comes up for you will use its advanced algorithm to make sure you are making the most amount of money possible. Additionally, since it factors in demand, it expects all the orders to be filled within 5-10 minutes. It also flags volatile items and filters out unprofitable ones, so that it is made sure you don't lose money! This means you are making each cycle of profit within 5-10 minutes. You can do the math yourself on how much that would make you an hour.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Example of Personal Bazaar Bot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFLIP BOT:\n\nDo you want to do the investing yourself? Are you a more advanced trader looking for the best flips out there? Say no more, as this bot ranks the top ten flips (buy order -> sell order) by both profit per flip possible, and profit percent (the amount of profit divided by the price of the flip, so you get the most bang for your buck). This list scans every item in the bazaar, and updates every 30 seconds.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Example of Flip Bot\n\n\n\nRanked by Profit:\n\n\n\n\nRanked by Profit Percent:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRAFT BOT:\n\nOne of the most profitable things you can do on the bazaar is buy items, craft them into some sort of product, and then sell that product. The hard part is finding which crafts are profitable, as that takes a lot of calculations. This bot scans every craft possible in the bazaar (there are over 100!), and then ranks them in the same format as the flip bot (by profit and profit percent). This bot assumes you are setting buy orders for that item, and then insta-selling the product (no risk involved). Also updates every 30 seconds.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Example of Craft Bot\n\n\n\nRanked by Profit:\n\n\n\n\nRanked by Profit Percent:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRASH BOT:\n\nThis bot is constantly analyzing the bazaar, and it reports any crashes in item prices. It will report both buy and sell order crashes. This is highly profitable as if you are one of the first to react to some sort of crash, you can get that item for insanely cheap prices and sell it for MASSIVE profits. In a single day, there are DOZENS of crashes, each with their own potential to make huge amounts of coins for relatively low investments.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Example of Crash Bot\n\n\n\nBuy Order Crash:\n\n\n\n\nSell Order Crash:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN SUMMARY:\n\nThere is a lot of money to be made with these bots. You can be the first to react to a crash on the bazaar, and make millions of coins in mere minutes. You can do your own analysis with the flip bot, or find easy money profits with the craft bot. If you just want to make money and not think at all, simply use the personal bot and it will tell you exactly what to do.\n\nThe best part? You don't ever have to rely on anyone else to make this money. No giving your coins to someone else, no relying on pings, no chance of a sca\u200em. These bots will always be up, day or night, so that you can make massive amounts of money from the bazaar. This is all allowed and legal, as I am simply doing calculations with the information that Hypixel themselves provide.\n\nUnfortunately because of high server costs and bot fees, we do have to charge a slight fee for full access to our bots (minikloon approved again btw, check our discord for screenshot proof). This is just to help keep the bots running on the server, as I am a broke college student and I can't afford the monthly payments myself. Don't want to pay? No problem! There are tons of ways you can get full access to our bots for free.\n\nWe give a free 30 minute trial, and another 12 hours of free usage if you leave a review on how you felt about the bot (can be good or bad, we don't care!). If you still want to use the bot after that, but can't pay, we give you free access to it simply by being active and talking! As you talk more in the discord channels, your rank increases, and eventually you can have full access to all of our bots without paying!\n\nStart making your millions today. Don't believe me? Come join our discord, and find out yourself.\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler\n\n\n\nhttps://discord.gg/2mzkatJ\n\n\n\n\ntl:dr - Use this bot to bazaar flip, go buy yourself a Superior Armor Set and Enderdragon Pet\n\n\u200b"

My reasoning for this is because regular profiles have such a big advantage over iron man profiles in the case that they can buy cookies and use bits, which means that they can acually get the builders wand and build a big farm way faster than an iron man profile would ever be able to, even with the edition of the new items and they can get better and better stuff just for being in late game already like the addition of being able to become farming level 60 and you know what that means more crops and an easier time getting gold all the time, meanwhile iron man profiles have no chance to become farming level 60 since you have to earn a gold medal to actually get the increased level cap. I could state a lot more reasons but I'll just leave it at this and hope you understand what I'm trying to say.\n\n\nTLDR: Regular profiles and iron man profiles farming contests should be separated ."

    "title": "Useful QOL Ideas",
    "body": "We got a lot of QOL items added with the recent Farm Merchant's Dwelling project being added, but I think there are some more things that could be implemented to further add to the QOL.\n\nIf you like these ideas, please bump to help try to get them added.\n\n1. An item that works similarly to the Prismapump or Basket of Seeds, except for normal blocks. Having to place things like slabs for a pumpkin farm or sea lanterns for a potato farm is fairly time consuming. This item, whatever it's named, will place a row of blocks until it hits an obstacle.\n\n\n2. Region Delete tool. It may be quite easy to place blocks now, but removing them is something completely different. This tool will allow players to select a specific region, then delete the selected region. Things like chests and item frames can be exempt to make sure valuable items aren't deleted.\n\n\n3. Personal Compactor. Just a plain Personal Compactor, no fancy numbers or anything. This item will work similarly to a personal compactor 4000/5000/6000, except instead of compacting items into their enchanted form, items will be compacted into their block form. This would make it so it is possible for wheat to automatically be compacted into enchanted hay bales, as well as being a good item for beginners to use to compact ores they mine early on in the game.\n\n\n4. Make the last version of Euclid's wheat hoe cheaper. No one in their right mind would get the last version of Euclid's Wheat hoe. Every other crop-specific hoe has a last version that is significantly cheaper.\n\n\nSpoiler: Reasoning\n\n\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean just the amount of coins it takes to craft, but the amount of raw items it takes as well. Every other crop-specific hoe needs around 6.5 million raw items or less. The Pythagorean Potato hoe needs 6.5 million normal potatoes, the Turing Sugar Cane hoe needs 6.5 million sugarcane, the Newton Nether Wart hoe needs 6.5 million nether wart, and the Gauss Carrot hoe only needs around 5.2 million. The price of these hoes varies, but it's usually around 14.5 million for the cheapest (Sugar Cane), and around 21 million for the most expensive (Nether Wart). I would say that's a fair price considering hoe good they are. Now, I would say Euclid's Wheat hoe is certainly not fairly priced. It needs over 47 million wheat. On top of that, it requires tightly-tied hay bales, which require enchanted hay bales, which are very difficult to get as of right now since there is no way to automatically compact wheat into enchanted hay bales. To get all those materials, it costs at least 250 million coins if the enchanted hay bales are bought cheap.\n\n\n\n\nThanks for reading"

    "body": "One day I thought to myself on where I was going to store some of my much rarer items. So began the construction of one of my most ambitious projects yet \"The Dark Treasury\" as already mentioned this was originally meant to be a place to showcase some of my more rare items, the build was too big and that was when it hit me. This wasn't just going to be a place where I displayed my rare items but a place where the community can showcase theirs too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently the complex consists of two floors that being the lower floor located in the centre and then the upper floor wrapping around the lower one. Right now there are only display cases on the bottom floor as we simply do not have enough items to exceed the bottom floors capacity, the upper floor will be used if necessary. A lobby is also situated at the entrance of the building to direct players in and give them all the crucial information required about the Dark Treasury. The five pedestals at the end of the building are guild related and so are not relevant in this post. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply just login to Hypixel, enter skyblock and type /visit Centranos. You will then spawn in at the lobby where you can read all about the build and it's purpose along with some rules.\n\n- For the best visual experience ensure the following settings are correct.\n- Have night vision disabled\n(This can be done by either toggling the potion effect in the booster cookie menu or by removing the night vision charm/despawning your bat pet if active.)\n\n- Have your brightness setting set to moody.\n(Esc > Options > Video Settings > Brightness.)\n\n- Full bright/ Gamma mods are disabled\n(If you can see the entire treasury lit up then it wouldn't be the dark treasury XD)\n\nIf the island disallows visiting/the wooden doors are closed in the lobby this means that the Dark Treasury is currently closed for either maintenance or I personally don't want to be disturbed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two ways to display your items, either you sell them to me or you donate them to me. If you sell them to me then they will just be placed in the hall. However if you donate items to me then your items shall be placed in the hall and your name/item donated shall be put on the wall of donations located in the main Dark Treasury lobby. We however must be in compliance with the Hypixel Skyblock abusive trading guidelines so each donation will be reviewed before proceeding.\n\nItems that I am specifically looking to buy are as followed\n- cluck the fish (idk if anyone has it)\n- Gamebreaker (Ready to be broke XD)\n- Placeable Heads\n\nIf you are interested in donating/selling items to me then either start a forum conversation with me or send a message in game. \n\nHave a great day/night and I hope that this is the start of something wonderful.\u200b"

My argument for legendary however is you can squeeze more XP out of it. I really am curious as to what I should do. I've already leveled two legendaries to 100 (mine and my coop's) so I was wondering what I should buy to level and resell.\nAlso: if anyone wants a pet leveling service for their silverfish add me in game  (Rare+)"

An RNG I book can be obtained as a rare drop (1/100) from a Sea Giant. The Sea Giant is a legendary fishing mob that has 20,000,000 health, and throws the player up 30 blocks into the air, dealing lots of damage and then 50x the fall damage. The only weakness of the Sea Giant is that it is slightly slower than most fishing mobs. An RNG V book would be very expensive to make, but very good. You can obtain RNG VI as a rare drop (1/100) from the Sea Titan, a legendary fishing mob that is extremely rare to find. The Sea Titan has 50,000,000 health, and shoots lasers at the player when they are in line of sight, dealing high damage per second. It is faster than the Sea Giant, and throws the player 60 blocks into the sky, and then 100x fall damage. Even though the Sea Titan is classified as a mini-boss, it is the hardest mob to kill in the game."

I don't have enough money to reasonably grind higher dungeon floors, and without the gear, I will be left in the dust. This post is a suggestion to make content suiting me, and everyone in the stage of game similar to me. \n\nIGoByLotsOfNames researched what percent of the player base is in which stage, and 48% of the playerbase is similar to me, so I know my problem is a plague infecting almost half of the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n time stamp 1:46\n\n\nAlright, lets get in to the suggestion. My idea is similar to dungeons, as you start in a hub, and find a que with other players instead of randomly trying to enter a party with completely random players, having completely random gear and weapons, your inventory and stats would get scanned, and based off the level of gear using gear score, you would be placed in another party with similar stats. There would be 3 person parties instead of 5, as waiting for 5 other people with your stats could take long.\n\nBased off your collective gear score and skill levels, you would be put in some sort of coliseum, with a wide range of difficulty of mobs. Everyone remembers how difficult and fun the end was at the beginning, and that would be the goal. There would be different drops from the mobs you fight in this arena, and those drops would be specifically used for that arena, so it wouldn't be overpowered in other parts of Skyblock. \n\nWith this idea, Skyblock wouldn't become boring, and the players similar to me, who can't play dungeons, would get a challenge, never getting bored with the game."

    "body": "Hi this is my first thread so go easy on me (or rather don't and tell me everything I did wrong lmao) If I missed anything or you want to add something just let me know!\n\nHALL OF BOSSES\n\nOverview: This would be a series of bosses that would range from extremely easy to incredibly difficult to even impossible (to prepare for future damage increases which are inevitable)\nOn release there would be only 1 boss (I'll explain why later), the first could be completed around the time you unlock the end and the 10th one would be EXTREMELY difficult in the games best gear. It would require groups of overpowered people to join together and try to take just one of these down. I think that this would work like the magma boss where it happens every 2 hours so it is accessible to everyone. I actually think the magma boss would be the first of the bosses as it can be easily defeated by a single person with aiming on their bow. The bosses stats such as health/damage would change depending on how high up the ladder this boss was. These bosses would grant combat xp as a way to get good amounts of combat xp based on how difficult the boss is to kill and how well you did in damage (there would also be loot drops but I don't know what to do for those) Defeating a boss for the first time in the top 3 would grant you 1 perk from that boss and would also allow you to continue to the next boss\n\nOther Notes:\nThe Admins (assuming this would actually get added) would have to prepare a few bosses in advance because the only way for the community to unlock the next boss would be to kill the current highest boss in under a single minute (this could be tweaked depending on how long the dialogue/boss fight takes without the killing the boss part) and they would have to prepare enough bosses where the highest one SHOULD be impossible for like 20+ people in the best gear in the game (Im talking like 1 billion+ health and ridiculous DPS.\nI don't want to go into the details of EVERY single boss because 1. I think part of the reasons most mega threads are never even considered by the Admins is because they don't give the Admins any creativity liberty for there work and 2. because I have like no ideas lmao. Although a few IDEAS and these are ideas only that I are shown here (their stats would be based on which boss it was):\n\nBoss 1: (note this doesn't have to be the first boss it's just the first idea)\nRoom 1: This would be a massive room that was based like you were underwater and in a coral reef. There should be enough coral to allow the player to hide and heal but not enough to make it feel like you're constantly running into it / enough to make the boss get stuck constantly making it super easy to kill. Note: you wouldn't literally be underwater.\n\nBoss Fight: Maybe you would be fighting like a siren or an underwater witch or something I don't know the actual entity that is the boss isn't really relevant but you can decide and let me know I guess. The bosses damage strategy would be based on DPS (so like 50% attack speed roughly and no true damage/ferocity) for the first phase of the boss fight the boss would try to shoot little beams of water (could be moving blocks of water or something created with particles) which would kind of freeze you in place in a way because of the damage ticks. Phase 2 would begin when the boss gets down to half health, The first thing the boss would do would to be go to the center of the room and rise off of the ground about 5-10 blocks. The boss would then release a massive shockwave that would 1 shot any player at the recommended level for this room. The players could survive by hiding behind coral or killing the boss while he is rising. Note: assuming the shockwave doesn't hit any coral/blocks, it would go to every corner of the room. If the boss was not defeated in the next minute or so, it would do this again (the groundpound type thing takes around 10 seconds for the whole process) and this would repeat until the boss was dead. During the time where he isn't in this process, he would act the same as in phase 1. \n\nBoss Perk: 1% more Sea Creature Chance\n\nBoss Drops: Maybe something to do with fishing (please suggest something for this in the comments)\n\nOther Notes: Aiming would not work on this boss to prevent bow spamming, the boss would drop things in the same way that the Magma boss, Dragons, and Endstone Protectors drops items.\n\nSUGGEST MORE THINGS TO ME IN THE COMMENTS"

    "title": "[IDEA] Some balancing on new farming update",
    "body": "I've been experiencing the new update on farming like almost everyone else and I believe there should be some small balancing changes.\nHere they are, ordered on what I think is more important first. Keep in mind, that's just my opinion.\n\n1. Nether warts giving alchemy exp\nI understand why it does and I know it's been like that since the start of skyblock, but I also think that, since it's part of a farming event that comes from a farming update, it should give farming xp.\n\nProblem:\nRight now, farming a nether wart gives 1xp whereas farming a sugar cane gives approx. 1.76xp if brewed from e. sugar cane (xp boosts excluded) so, except for the easier gold medal, there are absolutely no reason to farm it.\n\nAnother point is that the turing nether warts hoe give bonus farming xp, which is absolutely useless on a hoe meant for farming something that gives alch. exp.\n\nSolution:\nI see two possible solutions, there definitely are more, but this is my post so it's my opinion.\n\nIn a perfect world, I'd like to see nether warts give farming xp instead of alchemy. I also think that it could have a balancing in term of quantity of xp given, but I don't know about crops xp to propose anything.\n\nIf the farming xp way isn't possible (maybe because admins think that nether warts are meant to give alch exp, which I can understand) I'd like to suggest some small balancing with the current system.\nFirst, the hoe really should give alch exp bonus instead of farming. I think it's reasonable.\n\nSecond, I think we should up the given xp to something like 12 or maybe even 15xp per wart. Let me explain how did I come up with that number.\nAs I said earlier, a single harvested cane gives 1.76 alch. xp (45000 / 25600) when converted to e. sugar cane.\nHere's my setup for farming cane, which I think is at most average, if not under.\n- Farming 22 -> 88%\n- Sugar cane hoe -> 10%\n- Turbo cane 2 -> 10%\n- Harvesting 5 -> 62.5%\nWhich is 170.5% harvesting bonus so about 2.7 canes per broken cane, but, when farming cane, you harvest 2 blocks per broken block, so everytime you break a cane block, I'd get on average 5.4 canes, which is about 9.5 alch. exp per block broken.\nOn the other hand, warts only give a single exp per block broken.\n\nNow, I proposed 12xp because I'd like warts to be a substiantially better way to farm alch exp than simply farming cane and cane could be the more expensive but faster way of farming alchemy because, right now, I can spend 50m+ to max out alchemy or I can farm canes all day long but sugar cane is still the only real way to max out alchemy.\n\nSo 12xp would be good but why did I say even 15xp? Because warts take so-damn-long to grow.\nAn hour (real time) after harvesting and my farm is still only about 80% regrown, with some patches everywhere.\nWhereas my sugar cane is fully regrown only 30/40 min after harvest and my cocoa one only takes about 15/20min until I see that beautiful wall of brown bean.\n\nSo yeah, if we don't go to warts giving farming exp, I think that's the changes we could do and, even if we do change it to farming, I still think that 1xp is not enough to make it worth anyone's time.\n\n\n2. Coco chopper almost not bringing anything new\n\nProblem:\nEvery new farming item gives more collection in some way of another. Hoes give a straight up bonus to number of collected items whereas melon and pumpkin dicers gives a RNGesus drop.\nIt also doesn't give bonus farming exp, which every other tool does.\nLike right now, the only reason I bought a coco chopper is because I destroyed my wall way too many times with my replenish treecapitator (please don't judge, I was too lazy to craft another gold axe)\n\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we could add either a flat 5% farming exp bonus on it or a scaling one like hoes do.\nSecond since replenish already exist, I think that we could change that passive ability to something that gives bonus collection. It could be as simple as copying the pumpkin/melon RNG drop and it would a huge improvement in my opinion.\n\nEdit 1:\nI just tested it and it's replenish ability doesn't work like the enchantment does. If you break a not fully grown cocoa block, it doesn't replenish, which forces the user to care about which block they break instead of just going ham and breaking everything, which makes it exactly the same as using a normal golden axe with replenish.\n\nWith the normal axe, you need to be careful about not breaking logs\nWith the coco- chopper, you need not to break unrippened cocoa beans.\n\nTo solve this, I think that making it so that the chopper can only break fully grown cocoa block would be nice.\n\n3. Can't add harvesting to axes\n\nProblem:\nWe have a brand new farming update with 3 new farming tools that are axes, yet we can't add the most basic farming enchantment to it (outside of telekinesis).\n\nSolution:\nLet us add harvesting 5 to axes, if someone decides to add it so their raider axe, it's their will to do so."

The question is, during the farming events, I have been able to place bronze and silver a couple of times and I have been rewarded with enchanted books (as well as the usual tickets). These books grant a %5 increase in the chance for double crop drops. Since my percentage is already at 100 for double drops, do the stats somehow stack? Or are these books useless to me??

    "body": "I think that there should be an island after the end island called the plain of ultimate death, it will have wither mobs as the enemies. \nRight after you come here the first enemy you see is the baby wither skeleton with 1 million health and 1000 dps.\nThere are 6 areas with stronger and stronger mobs, each is the size of the end island and contains 5 unique mobs, aswell as an in depth boss battle between a strong wither ranging in health from 50 million, to 10 billion, and 5000, dps to 60000 dps aoe attack. \nEvery single mob drops a unique pet aswell as a powerful wither themed armor set, the bosses each drop 3 swords, one mage, one powerful all around sword, and one sword which deals alot of damage against withers. \nThere will be a new skill called withering which gives 10 ferocity per level, and is leveled by killing wither mobs and using wither items. \nThen there's a one in 10000 chance for each mob to drop a key, getting every key will unlock a specialised door at the end of the island permanently for you. \nHere you can fight the dual boss between wither king and mutant dragon every 4 hours, they will drop the most op gear in the game but only one drop from both if you dealt atleast 1b damage. \nThis gear is not sellable on ah and requires withering 50 to obtain and use, one of the drops is a withered heart which when crafted with a legendary lvl 100 enderdragon non tierboosted, and a legendary lvl 100 wither skeleton non tierboosted will get you the withered dragon pet which gives 100 of every stat and has every pet ability\n\nAnyway that was my short little idea, hope this get's added ty admins in advance love ya guys!"

    "title": "Another recent Dungeon tale with Zhirst",
    "body": "So as tradition its time for my weekly dungeons progress thread, nothing weird happened tbh, until 5 minutes ago, I was on f2 doing my mage duties clearing rooms and spreading incoming doom. We make it to scarf after an ungodly amount of time since a single aa ko'ed a good chunk of us, (including me but my frames dropped I have an excuse). We make it to scarf and murder his toys, and then scarf spawns and my team is dead, just me. I was just a simple mage, not even a bulky mage I was running dark goggles for damage since I didn't die as much. So I pissed my pants and ran for my life. Using my frozen scythe I stalled out enough time for one of my teamates to spawn, it was the protector dragon armor dude and he died. So I ran even more sweating from my pits. Then finally another teamate spawns. Dead immediately, and then scarf delivers this line \"yare yare daze\" and then he lifted up. I slowly realize about what he was going to do,so I did what I do best, run again. I manage to chip down the pric- I mean priest and my opportunity spawns, a teammate spawns and scarf targets him which gives mr time to heal with my manaflux and he dies. Not like we were getting an S anyways. He chips scarf just enough for my frozen scythe to pick up the k.o, and I fall from exhaustion. And that was the story on how I \"soloed\" scarf in **** gear\n\nMoral of the story: Don't do dungeons with protector users, and floor 2 is just as bad as floor 1"

There would be 10 waves and 2 boss waves.

Assuming one booster cookie is around 960k and provides 4,800 bits, the upgrade is worth 1.6M coins. Therefore, the cost to get 10 Ultimate Candy is 8 * 1.75M + 1.6M = $15.6M.

I realize there was nothing I did right with the PVPWars situation. I exploited a server's willingness to give me money and it was wrong. I can't even begin to explain how sorry I am to the people disappointed in me. It was a ****ty thing to do and I don't know why I did it. To be honest, it wasn't even about money. I stopped playing the server because I have the attention span of a two-year-old and I just didn't enjoy it any more. I could have paid them back at any time, but I chose to only do it as of two nights ago when one of my IRL friends heard about the situation. That was selfish of me, and not meeting the terms of a mutual agreement is something one should never do in my position. I am sorry to PVPWars if I financially hurt you in that time and scammed you. I paid them back the entire amount of $1,000 owed as of this morning, but that doesn't fix what I did in the moment. I don't know where Akinsoft pulled this $5000 number from, but that's just not true. I really want to continue making content for you guys. I really want to have time to grow and improve as a person, a friend, and a creator. If you hate me now, I understand, but if all of you would be willing to give me a second chance I would love to prove myself to you. I still have a lot to learn about this platform and a lot to give to this community, so please just allow me to keep creating. As for an actual verbal apology, I feel like making the video on my channel would be sort of exploiting my situation, and for that reason I will be going on Hypixel Alert to try and make some more things known about my wrongdoings. There was nothing excusable about my actions here, and me making a video to profit or gain subs off of it feels inherently wrong. I hope you guys are capable of forgiving me. I love the community I have built more than anything, and I will try and make this right. I will get better, we will get through this. I love you guys. - Menacing Banana\"\n\nHe says we should give him a second chance, which I can agree with. He owned up to his mistake, apologized, and returned the money he took. He will also be on Hypixel Alert to, \"try and make more things known about my wrongdoings.\" \n\nTell me what you think, does he deserve a second chance?"

So I'm not sure if the basket doesn't work for me only or a few other people. It clearly works for some people though.\n\nI've tried lots of different things to try and fix the basket. This included testing smaller areas, dropping it, making sure all the seeds were common, etc. but nothing worked.\n\nWhen I use the basket I place it on the first block of the row I want the seeds on, facing the direction the seeds should go.\n\nAm I using it wrong or is it just broken for me? Also, if it is broken is there a known fix or should I just send in a bug report?"

    "body": "https://hypixel.net/threads/wisconsin-michigan-pennsylvania-and-georgis.3510128/#post-25084718\n\n\n\nHere you can see brainwashed kids from college who think socialism is good.\n\nWhy Socialism doesn\u2019t work, written by an economist with a PhD, Mark Perry\n\n\nIf you are still convinced socialism is good, or are lazy to read, look up what happened to Venezuela they is what will happen to us.\n\nMarch 22, 2016\n\nSlightly more than 20 years, I wrote the article \u201cWhy Socialism Failed\u201d and it appeared in 1995 in The Freeman, the flagship publication of the Foundation for Economic Education. I think it was the first essay or op-ed I wrote for a general audience following graduation in 1993 from George Mason University with a Ph.D. in economics. Note that the title of the article (\u201cfailed\u201d) implied the past tense, as if I perhaps assumed the failures of socialism were so apparent and obvious (I called it the Big Lie of the 20th century) that it would be forever considered only as a discredited system of the past, and never as a viable option going forward into the future! Of course, at the time many parts of the world were moving away from collectivism and central planning and towards free market capitalism \u2013 the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, and China was opening up its economy and re-established the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 1990, etc.\n\nGiven the recent resurgence of socialism, especially as it is now being embraced by young Americans, I thought it might be a good time to re-visit my 1995 essay to review why socialism: a) failed in the 20th century, b) is failing in the 21st century (e.g. Venezuela, see photo above), and c) will always fail. And that\u2019s because it\u2019s a flawed system based on completely faulty principles that aren\u2019t consistent with human behavior and can\u2019t nurture the human spirit.\nHere\u2019s are some excerpts of my 1995 essay \u201cWhy Socialism Failed\u201d:\n\n\n\n1. Socialism is the Big Lie of the twentieth century. While it promised prosperity, equality, and security, it delivered poverty, misery, and tyranny. Equality was achieved only in the sense that everyone was equal in his or her misery.\nIn the same way that a Ponzi scheme or chain letter initially succeeds but eventually collapses, socialism may show early signs of success. But any accomplishments quickly fade as the fundamental deficiencies of central planning emerge. It is the initial illusion of success that gives government intervention its pernicious, seductive appeal. In the long run, socialism has always proven to be a formula for tyranny and misery.\nA pyramid scheme is ultimately unsustainable because it is based on faulty principles. Likewise, collectivism is unsustainable in the long run because it is a flawed theory. Socialism does not work because it is not consistent with fundamental principles of human behavior. The failure of socialism in countries around the world can be traced to one critical defect: it is a system that ignores incentives.\nIn a capitalist economy, incentives are of the utmost importance. Market prices, the profit-and-loss system of accounting, and private property rights provide an efficient, interrelated system of incentives to guide and direct economic behavior. Capitalism is based on the theory that incentives matter!\nUnder socialism, incentives either play a minimal role or are ignored totally. A centrally planned economy without market prices or profits, where property is owned by the state, is a system without an effective incentive mechanism to direct economic activity. By failing to emphasize incentives, socialism is a theory inconsistent with human nature and is therefore doomed to fail. Socialism is based on the theory that incentives don\u2019t matter!\n2. The strength of capitalism can be attributed to an incentive structure based upon the three Ps: (1) prices determined by market forces, (2) a profit-and-loss system of accounting and (3) private property rights. The failure of socialism can be traced to its neglect of these three incentive-enhancing components.\n3. By their failure to foster, promote, and nurture the potential of their people through incentive-enhancing institutions, centrally planned economies deprive the human spirit of full development. Socialism fails because it kills and destroys the human spirit\u2013just ask the people leaving Cuba in homemade rafts and boats [and those waiting in long lines today in Venezuela struggling, and often failing, to buy food].\n4. The temptress of socialism is constantly luring us with the offer: \u201cgive up a little of your freedom and I will give you a little more security.\u201d As the experience of this century has demonstrated, the bargain is tempting but never pays off. We end up losing both our freedom and our security.\nSocialism will remain a constant temptation. We must be vigilant in our fight against socialism not only around the globe but also here in the United States.\nThe failure of socialism inspired a worldwide renaissance of freedom and liberty. For the first time in the history of the world, the day is coming very soon when a majority of the people in the world will live in free societies or societies rapidly moving toward freedom.\nCapitalism will play a major role in the global revival of liberty and prosperity because it nurtures the human spirit, inspires human creativity, and promotes the spirit of enterprise. By providing a powerful system of incentives that promote thrift, hard work, and efficiency, capitalism creates wealth.\nThe main difference between capitalism and socialism is this: Capitalism works.\n\nClick to expand..."

A proof of my threads being agreed and altered was Dealing with forum nons v3, It got 7 positives and was thrown into off-topic sections of the forums. I am extremely infuriated from these events. Do the staff really care about the forums as they discourage voluntary exercises (that makes the forums batter) like anti-sh*tposting?\n\nWhat I suggest the staff to do:\nEither allow anti-sh*tposting movements just like how we repelled forum nons; or, make sh*tposting against the rules, so that us forumers can identify sh*tposters and report it to the online staff, so they could be banned for breaking server rules. Personally I would choose the latter.\n\nHave you been banned for anti-sh*tposting before? And which method do you think is better? Make sure to leave replies and vote in the poll!"

Then, it would open up into a trading section where you can toggle giving or borrowing. \n\nThe 'Giving' panel allows you to put up items, and set a time, both of which are visible to another person, and then the 'Borrowing' Panel, allows you to but up payment of some kind, similar to how a trade would work.\n\n\n\nIf two people select 'Giving' That fine, basically, they will both give items, that will be returned later (Things like collateral or something)\n\nIf two people select borrowing, it becomes a normal trade, as both people give a payment of some kind, without a time limit.\n\nBORROWED ITEMS CANNOT LEAVE YOUR INVENTORY.

Foraging 50 people went from getting an average of 3.9 logs per log broken to just 3.6 (see math spoiler). This is about 7.7% lower. I would hope that the admins change the monkey's perk to 90% so that it is not nerfed for any level of player.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Math\n\n\n\n\nBeforeAfterforaging lvlbase logswith monkeyforaging lvlbase logswith monkeyChange in absolute numbersChange in percent11.041.3511.041.64+0.29+21.5%21.081.421.081.68+0.28+20%31.121.4631.121.72+0.26+17.8%41.161.5141.161.76+0.25+16.6%51.21.5651.21.8+0.24+15.4%61.241.6161.241.84+0.23+14.3%71.281.6671.281.88+0.22+13.3%81.321.7281.321.92+0.2+11.6%91.361.7791.361.96+0.19+10.7%101.41.82101.42+0.18+9.9%111.441.87111.442.04+0.17+9.1%121.481.92121.482.08+0.16+8.3%131.521.98131.522.12+0.14+7.1%141.562.03141.562.16+0.13+6.4%151.62.08151.62.2+0.12+5.8%161.642.13161.642.24+0.11+5.2%171.682.18171.682.28+0.1+4.6%181.722.24181.722.32+0.08+3.6%191.762.29191.762.36+0.07+3.1%201.82.34201.82.4+0.06+2.6%211.842.39211.842.44+0.05+2.1%221.882.44221.882.48+0.04+1.6%231.922.5231.922.52+0.02+0.8%241.962.55241.962.56+0.01+0.4%2522.62522.6no changeno change262.042.65262.042.64-0.01-0.4%272.082.7272.082.68-0.02-0.7%282.122.76282.122.72-0.04-1.4%292.162.81292.162.76-0.05-1.8%302.22.86302.22.8-0.06-2.1%312.242.91312.242.84-0.07-2.4%322.282.96322.282.88-0.08-2.7%332.323.02332.322.92-0.1-3.3%342.363.07342.362.96-0.11-3.6%352.43.12352.43-0.12-3.8%362.443.17362.443.04-0.13-4.1%372.483.22372.483.08-0.14-4.3%382.523.28382.523.12-0.16-4.9%392.563.33392.563.16-0.17-5.1%402.63.38402.63.2-0.18-5.3%412.643.43412.643.24-0.19-5.5%422.683.48422.683.28-0.2-5.7%432.723.54432.723.32-0.22-6.2%442.763.59442.763.36-0.23-6.4%452.83.64452.83.4-0.24-6.6%462.843.69462.843.44-0.25-6.8%472.883.74472.883.48-0.26-7%482.923.8482.923.52-0.28-7.4%492.963.85492.963.56-0.29-7.5%5033.95033.6-0.3-7.7%\n\n\n\n\nOh, and before you try and tell me that the change doesn't affect foraging in this way, I tested it out myself, and this is exactly how it works."

I came out with a new idea so, hope you'll enjoy it!\n\nThe idea is all around a new sea creature, the Frost Archwizard, which can be fished in the Jerry Pond while being Fishing level 26 or more. It is quite similar to the Grim Reaper sea creature from the Spooky Fishing update, but he behaves like a Crypt Witherlord from Dungeons with the ability to float.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, it has two unique drops: the Frozen Tissue and the Frost Core. Also, he drops between 2-5 Frozen Tissues upon death.\n\nFrozen Tissues are used to craft a brand new armor set, the Frost Wizard Armor, which is made for a mage setup. It could be used for Dungeons ( the set could be converted into a dungeon set using Ice Essence, dropped from Frozen Adventurers. )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Frost Wizard Armor + Recipes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second item, the Frost Core, is quite similar to the Spooky Fishing's Vampire Fang. The only difference is, the Vampire Fang can be applied to the Bat Pet whereas the Frost Core can be applied to the Snowman Pet.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt makes the Snowman Pet perfect for Ice Fishing by adding a new perk aswell as a bonus +1% ( per 20 level ) Sea Creature Chance.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I do know my idea was slightly based on the Spooky Fishing update, but I'll try to add a bunch of unique stuff in the future when I get more inspiration.\n\nIf you feel like anything could be changed or added, send a comment including it and I'll maybe include it ( if you're fine with it, of course. )\n\nAs for now, have a nice day, take care of yourself!"

While he always admired his brother, Midas swore his kingdom would not end the same way.\" we can see that lore-wise he does have a brother and that something happened to his kingdom but that's about it.\n\nsome more ideas to the Mob: so, I really like Krakens I think they are extremely cool so why not make him ride a squid. if not a squid we can make it so he spawns up to 5 mobs in his life span which are the coral hunters(Btw yes I got this idea mainly from Davy jones)\n\nlately, the fishing updates were great and they introduced Harder sea creatures for example The Great White Shark, the Grimm Reaper, and the phantom fisher\n\nso I want an extremely challenging boss(it doesn't have to be ofc but it'll be kinda cool) and a high fishing skill level requirements\n\nHope the idea catches someone's interest.have a good day!"

    "title": "Why did they make mage weapons so op?",
    "body": "Mage was op af, since there were really good magic dmg spam weapons like fs and bonzo staff, and not spammable, but very powerful weapons like ink wand and pigmans. Bc of that, they \"nerfed\" mage by slightly nerfing how ability dmg works, and also made some weapon abilities worse. But with nerfing mage woweee they added the spirit sceptre, a spammable weapon with really good damage. This was actually a buff to mage due to how op the spirit sceptre was. Mage was still the best class in terms of dps due to splash damage, and magic dmg usually outclassing regular dmg. F5 came, berserk got a huge buff due to sa armor, a new dps set, the livid dagger and flower of truth, the new best weapons. Mage was still better bc of yeti sword, and then they released the midas staff. Idk how they thought adding a better weapon to the already seriously op magic damage/mage class, not in the way most items get buffed like 1.2x or something, it almost doubles the damage of the yeti sword. Now getting decent damage without magic damage is impossible on golems, and fs literally took over the end/any type of grinding. Voodoo doll is busted on drags, and using even the best swords will get you no where . Im just saying, stop buffing mage weapons, maybe give the voodoo doll/midas staff a little damage of a nerf, or add some new bows and swords that can compete with the midas staff, like buff the midas sword idk"

This could be a brand new server that Default ranks could access more easily, which would be great! Also, everyone couldn't access their main Skyblock profiles on the second server.

    "body": "So this may get lost in the endless flow of posts saying \"NeRf FroZen BlaZe ArmoR\" or \"I'Ve FouNd a GamEbReakIng GliTch\", but I've come to the conclusion that as a community, we need a modpack that refines this online cobblestone mining simulator into a real RPG, the way it should be.\nI've taken some time to think about what Mods would make Skyblock feel special.\nI have looked at what makes an RPG so immersive. This is mainly the graphics, the soundtrack, the ambience, etc.\nI have looked at many Minecraft mods and came up with the best solution to this I can.\nI even installed a Skyblock resourcepack to give the items custom textures, however, I know some people prefer the PvP texturepack feel, so I've tried to cater to everyone.\nThere\u2019s only 18 mods included so far, so let me know if you have any ideas.\nJust watch the trailer to see what you think:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo this modpack has many features, I'll list a few here:\n\n\nCustom Soundtrack to Enhance the RPG Feel.\nCustom textures for 99% of the items in Skyblock\nShaders and visuals for low to high-end systems\nDynamic ambient noise which changes to match your environment.\nUpdated for every Skyblock Addons update so you never need to go out of your way to update\nZealot counter to keep track of eyes and kills\nAFK FPS Reducer to save power when AFKing.\nAlso some people in the comments seem to be confused about what mods are actually present in the pack, so these are what\u2019s in the modpack as of release 0.7.4.\n\nAmbience\nAutoTip\nBetterFPS\nBlur\nCustomMainMenu\nDynamic Surroundings\nFoamfix\nFullbright\nItemPhysic Lite\nMouseDelayFix\nNoCloseMyChat\nOptifine\nResource Loader\nShoulder Surfing\nSidebar Mod\nSkyblock Addons\nFPS Reducer\nZealotCounter\n\n\nSo that's about it. I think the trailer speaks for itself. If you think this is something that interests you,\nhead over to https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/skyblock-enhanced-hypixel.1577429 to download it!\n\nThe reason I have used technicpack rather than just releasing a mod folder is so that it will automatically update for you when I modify the pack. I will not release it as a mod folder. Technic is a trusted resource and allows for easy updating of the modpack. \n\nI do not take any credit for any of the mods in this modpack.\nThanks,\ntrolliver."

    "title": "Necron Boss Fight [High-Effort Post] [140+ Positive Reactions]",
    "body": "In my mind, the Necron boss fight is meant to be an elegant and difficult boss fight that is not meant to be completed really quickly.\nIt would have multiple phases.\n\nNote: It is highly recommended to have no duplicate classes for a phase in the fight.\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 1\n\n\n\nPhase 1:\nNecron: Enough of this. I grow tired of your weak amusement.\nLost Adventurer: No, please!\n*Necron smites the LA*\nNecron: Now, who's next? I do hope you can keep me entertained for at least a while.\n(First time going in the dungeon Necron dialogue :) \nNecron: Ah. Yes. I've heard of you adventurers, smiting each of my wonderful generals floor after floor. Every time I expect you to fail and every time I am disappointed. And yet, I'm overjoyed. I'm overjoyed because an irritating pest will finally be eradicated!\n\nIn Phase 1, Necron summons hordes of mobs from every angle. The objective of this phase is to damage Necron to 80% health while not dying. Necron has different states where only a specific class can hit him (Notably this is why no duplicates is recommended.)\nThe 5 states are:\nNecron: Your blades fall to my splendour! No-one but a mage could leave a scratch on me!\nNecron: Your health pales in comparison to mine! No-one but a tank could hurt my pride!\nNecron: Your weapons lay decaying from my wonderful barrier! Nothing but an arrow from an Archer could leave a scar!\nNecron: Your magic is useless against me! Unless a berserker struck me with his sword, I should be immortal!\nNecron: Your healing is so inferior! Only a healer could damage my reputation!\n\nNecron switches states every 15 seconds, giving ample time for each class to do damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.1 - Bonzo\n\n\n\nPhase 2.1:\nAfter Necron drops 20% HP (Note, I have no idea how much he's going to have so I'm putting it in percentage.)\n\nNecron: I notice your power grows as you crawl the dungeon. Your teamwork makes your strength amplified as you take blessings from my chests. MY chests! It's time for you to feel the consequences of looting what you shouldn't touch.\n\nFor every blessing you find, Necron reduces your health by 2%. This can be DEVASTATING. Notably, if you take no blessings throughout the dungeon run, the maximum score you'd ever get is an S.\n\nThis is a really big phase, as it goes through every single boss again.\nYou get 3 blessings after beating each boss. You can see the items that are in your chests before deciding if you want to take the loot or go to the next phase. Taking the loot ends the run.\n\nNecron: How come you defeated Bonzo? I know he's weak, but he managed to become a general for a reason. Let's replay that fight!\n(You get teleported to the Bonzo fight.)\nBonzo: Thank you for the chance to redeem yourself. Die flashily! (Yes. One Piece reference)\nBonzo has learned how to teleport between each of the pillars you see in the Bonzo room. He also has a significant increase in health and damage. Bonzo is the easiest boss to fight in this phase, but he is not easy. Each time he teleports to a pillar, he stops for exactly 5 seconds and sends out a barrage of balloons. When he is at 50% health, he only stays at each pillar for 4 seconds and shoots balloons twice as fast.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.2 - Scarf\n\n\n\nPhase 2.2:\nAfter Bonzo is defeated, Necron gives you a choice:\nNecron: I am impressed. You managed to defeat my clown! You can quit here and take new and improved items from Floor 1. Alternatively, you can continue on to Scarf's reincarnation. I know he's eager.\n\nLoot you can get:\nCursed Bonzo Staff : The cursed bonzo staff costs 0 mana to cost and has no cooldown. It notably does as much damage as a 5 star spirit sceptre without being starred.\nPainted Iron: 9 of these Painted Iron items will form a Party Cannon, which can be shot at a 5 second cooldown for 1000 mana and does a LOT of damage.\n\nScarf Fight:\nScarf: You told me to train for another 100 years if I wanted to defeat you. I got started, and now I'm here. Its time to dance.\n\nScarf has the ability to summon 5 EXACT COPIES of the 5 player's stats and damage. Meanwhile, he has increased health and damage, and shoots the soul sand spikes occasionally, slowing all the players and debuffing them. When he hits 50% HP, he revives all the copies (if theyve died) and increases their speed by 300%.\n\nWhen Scarf dies, he says:\nScarf: 'Mother... I'll finally be with you again...' (yikes thats kinda deep)\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.3 - Professor\n\n\n\nPhase 2.3:\nAfter Scarf is defeated, Necron gives you the same choice.\nNecron: 'I'm impressed with the way you keep going at my generals. That poor Scarf lost his mother in a terrible accident. Didn't stop him from dying. You can take the loot from this area, or continue on. The Professor is ready to school you.'\n\nLoot you can get:\nScarf's Diary: This is an epic dungeon item talisman. It seems Scarf really held this dear to his chest.\nRidiculously Wise: This is an Ultimate Enchant that reduces the mana cost of items by 7.5% per level, and can go up to level 10.\n\nProfessor Fight:\nProfessor: I'm ready to teach this class. Are you ready to learn a lesson?\n\nThe Professor is in the middle of teaching a class to a school of guardians. The guardians swarm the players, zapping them and stunning them in place. The Professor is stuck in a state of being transformed into a guardian, and occasionally shoots lasers, drops TNT, smites everyone, or just heals everything. He is completely invincible until the guardians are dead, in which case he triggers the four abilities of his guardians (sans healing) thrice as fast. Health and damage is increased etc etc.\n\nWhen the Professor dies, he says:\nProfessor: Hopefully my students take my teachings with them and remember me after I die...\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.4 - Thorn\n\n\n\nPhase 2.4:\nAfter the Professor is defeated:\nNecron: 'Your power is certainly unparalleled. The last batch of adventurers didn't even make it past Bonzo. You can stop here, and take the items from the Professor, or continue on to the next phase.'\n\nLoot you can get:\nMetamorphosis Armour: This is a buffed up version of adaptive that can be worn on any class. It gains 2 strength for every F3 completion you have, up to (insert number here) per piece.\nMetamorphosis Blade: This is a buffed up version of the Adaptive Blade that does (x) amount of damage per hit.\nSuper Serum: This is a REQUIREMENT to defeat F6-10 Necron-ified bosses. Using one Super Serum makes the bosses vulnerable, as without using the Super Serum they are completely invulnerable. It costs 1mil to get it. (yay. deflation!!)\n\nThorn Fight:\nThorn: I appreciate you coming to give another round of entertainment. But it seems my crowd wont take this one sitting down.\n\nIn the thorn fight, lost adventurers, frozen adventurers and shadow assassins all come, paired with the constant spirit animals flowing down. The Spirit Bear has become corrupted and attacks twice as fast. Upon killing the Spirit Bear, Thorn automatically gets damaged so you don't need to worry about hitting shots. Each death enrages the mobs, making them 10% faster. Thorn himself joins the fight, shooting fireballs that deal 2500 True Damage per hit, but move pretty slowly.\n\nWhen Thorn dies, he says:\nThorn: At least it was fun. Please don't hurt the animals, we vegans would hate to see that happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.5 - Livid\n\n\n\nPhase 2.5:\nAfter Thorn is defeated:\nNecron: 'Livid is, well, livid. Meet him in the next room, or grab the loot from here. Although I recommend bringing something special, otherwise you might not survive.'\n\nLoot you can get:\nPulsating Spirit Wing: Crafting three of these will make a Pulsating Spirit Sceptre, which costs 100 mana per use and deals (x) amount of damage per hit.\nPulsating Spirit Bone: Crafting this will make a Pulsating Bonemerang, which has no distance limit and comes back regardless of hitting a wall. It also does (x) amount of damage per hit, increasing by 10% each time it hits a consecutive enemy in one throw.\nSuper Serum\n\nNOTE: From here on out, there is absolutely no way to kill the bosses without using a Super Serum. If you lose the fight, the Super Serum is gone for good. It takes one Super Serum per fight continuing on.\nNotably, it is impossible to kill the bosses with F9+ gear, and you would need the special items from the previous floors.\n\nLivid Fight:\nLivid: I feel amazing. I feel immortal. Don't you?\nIf even one party member has a Super Serum, this is the opportunity to right click it and multiply every party member's stats by 10. You can do this in earlier floors, but this is basically necessary to fight F5-10 copies.\n\nLivid spawns 9 clones that are super buffed up. When a clone is sub (x) amount of health, they teleport away to regenerate at a rate of (x) per second. This means it is impossible to use cheese tactics such as the eagle strat as the lower HP livids will TP away. You have to be able to chase and track down each Livid. Notably, you have to kill all 9 to win the fight, and they don't respawn.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.6 - Sadan\n\n\n\nPhase 2.6:\nNecron: 'It astonishes me that you found my serum. I'm kind of angry. Well, Sadan should take care of you just as good. That is, if you choose to meet him.'\n\nLoot you can get:\nFlawless Livid Dagger: This is a livid dagger that grants 50 ferocity on top of 100 cc and 100 attack speed. It also has (x) damage and strength.\nFlawless Shadow Fury: This is a shadow fury that costs no mana and has no cooldown. It also has (x) damage and strength.\nLivid Goggles - Livid Robes - Livid Leggings - Livid Boots: This is an upgraded Shadow Assassin set. It spawns a clone of yourself that does significant portions of damage and takes all mob aggro off you until your clone is dead.\nSuper Serum\nUltra Swarm - Just swarm but 5x better\n\nSadan Fight:\nSadan: Are you ready to die, puny humans?\nIf even one party member has a Super Serum, this is the opportunity to right click it and multiply every party member's stats by 10. You can do this in earlier floors, but this is basically necessary to fight F5-10 copies.\n\nSadan is ready to fight. His 4 giants are standing, and his main body is also there. You don't need to kill the other 4 giants, but they constantly harass you. Sadan's main giant does significant portions of damage, and he has a 5th giant called the Missile Man all the way at the other side of the room. He cannot move, but at the 2 minute mark starts sending huge arrays of missiles that all do true damage. The idea is to either kill the Missile Man or finish Sadan within two minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.7 - Maxor\n\n\n\nPhase 2.7:\nNecron: 'Each of my generals continues to disappoint. Take the loot or be prepared to fight Maxor.'\n\nLoot you can get:\nFluorescent Flower: Crafting 9 of these forms the Flowing Flower of Power. This is a better version of the flower of truth that has a limit of 15 chained mobs and costs 200 mana per usage.\nSadan Goggles - Sadan Robes - Sadan Leggings - Sadan Boots: This is an upgraded necromancer lord set.\nSuper Serum\nUltra Legion - Just legion but 5x better\n\nMaxor Fight:\nI'm leaving this empty because we haven't seen the Maxor fight. I don't want to make any assumptions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.8 - Goldor\n\n\n\nPhase 2.8:\nNecron: Maxor was too young to fight properly. Lets see you up against Goldor, one of the most experienced in my army! Take the loot or be prepared for mortal combat.\n\nGoldor Fight:\nI'm leaving this empty because we haven't seen the Maxor fight. I don't want to make any assumptions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.9 - Storm\n\n\n\nPhase 2.9\nNecron: If Storm doesn't stop you now, I'll be forced to deal with you myself. Take the loot while you still can.\n\nStorm Fight:\nI'm going to be putting my interpretation of the Storm fight here. Subject to change when Storm gets released.\n\nStorm: I'm mad. I'm so mad! I feel so cold. So hot. I'm fired up! Prepare to die.\n\nStorm is a sociopath elementalist. with multiple personalities. Every 20 seconds, he changes his personality and the manner of the fight will change.\n\nWindy Storm:\nWhen Storm is in his Wind phase, he sends arrows flying from every direction and anvils falling from the ceiling, meanwhile smiting you with lightning.\n\nFiery Storm:\nWhen Storm is in his Fiery state, he summons Magma bosses and ghasts from the ceiling to attack you.\n\nLiquid Storm:\nWhen Storm is in his Liquid state, he summons Sea Emperors and Great White Sharks to attack you.\n\nStonewall Storm:\nWhen Storm is in his Stonewall state, he summons Gaia Constructs and such to attack you.\n\nKilling Storm ends Phase 2 YES LMAO WE'RE STILL IN PHASE 2 . \n\n\n\nPre-Phase 3:\nNecron: DISAPPOINTMENTS! All of them. Nothing but disappointing. Take the loot or die.\n\nStorm Loot:\nwell i dont know lmao wait for them to make the loot table\n\n\n\nPHASE 3\nNecron himself finally joins the battle. He's ready to roll. He charges a lightning attack for one minute, while summoning swarms of mobs to fight you. If he charges up fully, he starts laughing and completely kills one player at random. The only way to subvert his lightning is to stand on 5 pressure plates behind him, which restarts his charge. Killing all of the mobs forces Necron to fight you himself, where he shoots wither skulls and smites everyone occasionally dealing true damage.\n\nPHASE 4 \nWhen Necron is at 50% HP, he goes berserk. This mechanic comes back:\nThe 5 states are:\nNecron: Your blades fall to my splendour! No-one but a mage could leave a scratch on me!\nNecron: Your health pales in comparison to mine! No-one but a tank could hurt my pride!\nNecron: Your weapons lay decaying from my wonderful barrier! Nothing but an arrow from an Archer could leave a scar!\nNecron: Your magic is useless against me! Unless a berserker struck me with his sword, I should be immortal!\nNecron: Your healing is so inferior! Only a healer could damage my reputation!\n\nEvery mob in the game is summoned all at once (Ranging from a chicken to the Woke Golem to every single boss in the catacombs) and you will have to kill them all. All this while, Necron is still charging his lightning blast. If all the mobs are killed, Necron fights you himself, shooting thrice as fast and smiting way more.\n\nPHASE 5\nWhen Necron is at 20% HP, he attempts to negotiate with the players.\nNecron: You're doing well. I'll give you the chance to open the Obsidian Chest behind me if you end the run here. Just open the chest.\n\nOpening the chest will instantly kill all of the players.\nGEEEEET DUNKEDD ONNNN\n\nHitting Necron will continue the fight. He removes all the blessing buffs from the players and de-equips all their pets. Shuffles their inventory, freezes them in place, and summons even more frozen adventurers and shadow assassins.\n\nPHASE 6\nWhen Necron is at 10% HP, he goes crazy and summons 25 Shadow Assassins. He charges up for 3 minutes, meaning at the end of 3 minutes, every single player dies. If the players manage to kill the Shadow Assassins, Necron finally comes out and fights them, being EXTREMELY POWERFUL.\n\nIf you defeat Necron after all of this, congratulations! You deserve it from me and from necron.\n\nNecron: You... You puny adventurers.. I'll get you for this! You hear me, I will! You'll never survive in the (insert next dungeon name here). My friend (insert friends name here) will make sure of it! *necron warps out*\n\n\nSpoiler: Loot from Necron\n\n\n\nLoot:\nNecron's Skull: You managed to sever off one of his three heads. Might as well wear it. Increases rate of gaining Catacombs EXP by 20% along with other stats\nNecron's Ribcage: You managed to rip out his ribcage. Why not wear it? Increases rate of gaining Catacombs EXP by 20% along with other stats\nNecron's Leggings: He wears leggings? Increases rate of gaining Catacombs EXP by 20% along with other stats\nNecron's Boots: Wait, doesn't he float? Increases rate of gaining Catacombs EXP by 20% along with other stats\n\nNecron's Sceptre: This shoots wither skulls that explode. Best mage weapon in existence for clearing rooms\nNecron's Crossbow: This is just a really powerful bow that does TRUE DAMAGE!. Great for archers\nNecron's Cutlass: An incredibly powerful sword that gives you 300 ferocity.\nNecron's Beating Heart: An upgrade to the plasmaflux which does NOT require Wolf 7 but instead Catacombs lvl 45.\nNecron's Slammer: A sword which stuns enemies when you hit them. Damage and stun duration amplified as Tank.\n\nAnd other stuff too! Its up to the admins.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Some ideas I had for loot\n\n\n\nImpatient - Ultimate Enchant - Gain 1/2/3/4/5% extra damage on your next hit for each second since your last attack, up to a max of 20/40/60/80/100% extra damage.\n\nOverdrive - Ultimate Enchant - The cooldown of this weapon goes down 10/20/30/40/50%.\n\nArm for an Arm - Ultimate Enchant - Take 50% more damage from all sources. Deal 40/80/120/160/200% of that damage reflected as true damage to the next enemy you hit. Cooldown of 2 seconds.\n\nSoul Piercer - Tank Weapon - This weapon deals its damage + your ehp as true damage per hit.\n\nPacifism - Ultimate Enchant - Take 10/20/30/40/50% less damage and deal 35% less damage.\n\nGreed - Ultimate Enchant - Gain 2/4/6/8/10 Magic Find.\n\nOverpowering - Ultimate Enchant - Deal 10/20/30/40/50% more damage and take 100% more damage.\n\nBroken Claw - Reforge Stone - (Legendary) Adds 35 Ferocity to the weapon.\n\n\nSOME CLOSING NOTES:\nUpon killing a Necron Converted Boss i.e. Bonzo v2, you do NOT have to fight it again if ALL 5 PLAYERS have killed Bonzo v2. Instead, Bonzo v2 can be fought in the Master Mode for F1. Same goes for all the floors.\nSuper Serum does NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT work in the overworld.\nIts meant to take hours to complete everything. Notably, all of the resurrected bosses wont be fought more than once (unless you want to farm the items or the Super Serum in Master Mode.) so it wont actually take so long youd want to die\nTHERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY TO FINISH THIS IN ONE SHOT. NO POSSIBLE WAY. You at LEAST need super serum and the items from the revived bosses\n\n\n\nSpoiler: EDIT: Master Mode F10\n\n\n\nsince people were continually asking for F11 or a glitched F10 boss, here it is. master mode f10. I intend this to be extremely difficult.\n\nNecron: You dare return? After you disgraced me so badly? Enough is enough. This is the end for you.\n*Necron takes a crystal and fuses with it (this is a Soul Orb).* This should be enough to defeat you. I am now immortal! I am almighty! I am... EXALTED!\n\nEXALTED NECRON Phase 1 \nExalted Necron is extremely powerful. Throughout the boss room there are five archwizards who all have a beam connected to Necron. They respawn within 30 seconds of being killed, and all immediately respawn if someone dies. They cannot attack but are instead really tanky. As long as even one is alive, Necron is immune.\n\nWhile his archwizards are alive, he does the following attacks:\n\nThe pattern of the floor is a checkerboard pattern with three colours. Every so often, Necron will choose one colour at random and strike lightning on it dealing true damage. This will be indicated by the block turning red. Thats right, for every three blocks, one lightning will strike. \n\nNecron just straight up kills everyone in a 3 block radius from him. Yeah dont go near him while he's Exalted.\n\nNecron summons hordes of skeletor primes to attack you.\n\nNecron goes to the middle of the room and starts shooting arrows in a spiralling motion. For example look at this +.The dot in the middle of the + would be Necron and the lines would be arrows dealing true damage, moving in a circular motion.\n\nWhen his archwizards are inactive they take one minute to respawn. He strikes lightning on two blocks instead of one, and twice as frequently. He sends wither skulls flying in every direction and blinds players, shuffles their inventory, teleports them to random places in the room, and just messes with them. He goes back into that specific phase where only one class can hit him at a time. \n\nGetting Necron to 20% HP makes him send you all to a void in an attempt to stop you from killing him. One player will remain in the boss room (spirit leaps disabled) and he fights one player at a time for 30 seconds each.\n\nObviously, he would do some more cool things but I have a test in like 4 days so I'll stop here. \n\nLoot:\nI can't give any loot, but at least one I must say:\nSoul Orb: Applies the Exalted reforge (Only chestplates) - + x defence and + x health. Bonus Ability: EXALTED! You are Exalted, and everything fears you. You are untouchable! You have 10 charges, one charge recharges in 10 seconds. Taking a hit nullifies the damage and loses one charge.\n\n\nI hope you enjoyed my huge high effort post. I couldve made probably 10mil by now but instead I typed this down. Like the post if you like the post, and dislike it if you dont. Bump it if you want others to see it."

Meaning, by sacrificing the use of a hoe with harvesting 5 (62.5% to double drops), you are replacing your tool with something that only gives a 25% double drop chance.\n\nEffectively, doesn't this make the Turbo-Cacti enchant useless?\n\nIf anyone knows a solution to this, where I can have turbo-cacti as well as harvesting on the same tool, please tell me"

    "title": "Comprehensive guide for Mages, All budgets, All catacombs levels - Open for suggestions",
    "body": "Hello skyblock players. Are you a mage? Do you want to be a mage? Are you LCM or RCM? Are you wondering whether you SHOULD go LCM or RCM? What does RCM or LCM mean? This guide includes everything you need to know about mages, how to play the class, how to play WITH the class and the terminologies used within our little mage community. Through testing I have found a few things that are really good but hidden under the eye lid of skyblock players, that can instantly boost ur mage experience. Let's get started!\n\nFirst of all, what is LCM or RCM? The term LCM means left-click mage, which is essentially where a player uses berserker talisman reforges, mage armor reforges and berserker weapons to use the mage beam and attack mobs. Many of the top players use this setup, which can be extremely powerful, and WAS the best mage setup before the addition of the midas staff. However, it is only good if 1. You are rich (300m - 700m), or 2. You are extremely high catacombs lvl (30 - 35). I don't recommend anyone to go LCM unless you are in one of those categories.\n\nWhat is RCM? RCM is right-click mage, or the mage that we all know. This type of mages are a lot more common in floors 1 -5 and you will most likely only see LCMs in Floor 6 in high-catacombs groups. This type of mages are really flexible in the gear that they can choose, as well as just being fun to play.\n\nGuide: What gear do I get?\nNow this part is difficult; because everyone has different budgets and different catacombs lvls. I'll be listing a few of the prototypes here, but if your situation is not on the list, ask it in the comment section and I'll help you, as well as adding your situation onto the guide.\nI will not be including budget / low catacombs lvl setups; Frozen scythe, zombie soldier / dark goggles or bonzo mask, sheep pet. Never go bonzo staff.\n\nCatacombs 16 - 20, budget of 20m - 30m\nFrozen scythe 5 starred.\nSuper heavy chestplate\nNecromancer lord leggings\nSpirit boots\nLegendary sheep pet lvl 70+\n\nCatacombs 21 - 24, budget of 31m - 50m\nSpirit sceptre\nFrozen scythe 5 starred\nSame armor as before, but with necromancer lord boots, and if you wish to do f6 use giant reforge on chestplate. Maybe use a mender fedora in boss fight.\n\nCatacombs 21 - 25, budget of 50m - 70m\n10 - 20 / 30m Midas staff, only use if you are catacombs 25 or above, OR if you are catacombs 24 and you'll probably get catacombs 25 soon.\n^ is surprisingly good, when dungeonised is about 2x better than 5 star yeti, for about the same cost and way lower catacombs level requirement.\nSame stuff as before, but use t9 / t10 chestplate and it's your choice if you wish to keep the frozen scythe or not. I didn't, but I recommend you to.\n\nCatacombs 26 - 29, budget of 70m - 110m\nSame weapons, but change 2/4 necromancer lord to wise dragon armor if you wish for more damage.\nYou may also switch to tierboosted enderdragon if you have the money.\nYeti sword is a waste of time quote @GamingDevil \n\nCatacombs 30 or above is where LCM because relevant. If you are still wishing to be RCM, use an 100m Midas staff.\nOtherwise,\nLivid dagger\n5 star Tarantula helmet with 3/4 shadow assassin\nLegendary ender dragon (TB or non TB doesn't really matter)\nLivid dagger (Giant's sword may work but I prefer livid)\nSpirit sceptre\nArmor on necrotic / loving, talismans on shaded, sword on fabled.\n\nNow, what do I need to be aware of when playing WITH a mage?\nMages tend to have quite the ego. The ego might help them if they know what they are doing, but if they don't, do not get in an argument with them. You will lose brain cells.\nAlso, Mages like to solo things. So take care of your baby mages. If they are good, let them run free. If they aren't, either be careful and help them, or\n/p leave, /warp dungeon_hub, /ignore add *mage*\n\n\nPlease leave suggestions! No hate towards anyone, only here to help.\nIF you leave a reaction, please comment why!"

    "title": "How You Can Get ENCHANTING 50 FAST",
    "body": "After 8-10 long and hard hours, I got enchanting 50. Now you might be thinking that 8-10 hours for enchanting 50 is extremely long, but actually, if you do the math, at 9 hours for 55.5m exp is ~6.2m per hour including breaks. This is because I used the surprisingly unpopular \"Skypixel\" mod that changes the enchanting table menu to the vanilla one (link: here *please note this is not my mod and all credit for this mod goes to the creator, prplz, lots of love to him*) Also, make sure you are obviously using level 95-100 epic/leg guardian, exp 4 potion WITH Viking tear, and exp boost 3 pot (basically a god potion, but not everyone uses those) + obviously a booster cookie. If you aren't going to 50, and even if you are, I'd highly recommend barrowing a pet, not buying, unless you get some absurdly low price. Also, a tip for people who struggle with double splashing, find a good dpi AND sensitivity. DPI affects IN menu and outside of menu moving, sensitivity is just outside moving. Also obviously use auto or large GUI scale.\nAnother quick thing while I'm at it, DO NOT, I AM SERIOUS, DO NOT GO FROM 0-50 IN 1 SITTING. It seriously hurts your hand and can cause LASTING HAND CRAMPS, I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE. If you have the materials, go from 0-35 to 43/44 THEN to 50, a lot easier.\nAnyway, go to the corner of the bookshelves and crouch a bit nearer to the crafting table, it helps you get closer and helps you double splash less. If you have bad ping, first of all you're screwed, and second of all make sure to time it correctly so you can anticipate when the enchantment table will open and close so you can make a rhythm that works for you. Also if enchanting frustrates you, I'd highly recommend doing it one hour at a time, personally helped me get used to it. Other than that, you should be good! Just have fun and maybe time yourself to see how fast you can get Arthritis...\n\n\nI mean clear out a stack of grands!"

    "body": "I usually play on blc because of its decent mods and pretty good fps. (Lunar gives less fps.) I only use forge for dungeons since it has very good mods, but little fps. But the more i play dungeons, the less fps i get. And after awhile, i run out of memory and then all textures turn white, then mc crashes. So I have 2 reasons why this is happening.\n\n1. Minecraft is taking up most of my gpu/cpu/memory\n\nI have used task manager to find this information.\nThese are the main apps i usually have.\n\n\n\n\nFrom this image, we can see that Minecraft (Java(TM) Platform SE Binary) has aa whopping 2900 megabytes (2.9 gigabytes), 25% of my cpu/gpu, and is taking up a very large amount of the power coming from my battery. The second most app that is taking the most of my computer is Chrome. Only taking up 180 megabytes, 2% of my cpu and 0% of my gpu. As well as taking up a very small amount of energy. Since Chrome is known for taking up a good amount of space, the next app is Discord. Taking up only 90 megabytes, 0% of cpu/gpu, and a small amount of power. I really dont know why this is happening but it really doesn't seem like MC is supposed to take up almost 3 gigs. This really doesn't have much evidence on its own, so were going to the next reason why this is happening. Mods\n\n2. Using a lot of mods may affect the fps.\nI use Refraction's mod folder v4 with some minor adjustments. Here are the mods I use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've heard about some mods affecting fps, but I don't know which ones. If you know, please tell me. People have also said that patcher makes a lot of difference, although for me it doesn't seem like it is. Tell me again how I can fix that.\n\nConclusion: I really don't know why this is happening. And I REALLY don't wanna play dungeons on blc. So any support would be great."

    "title": "My Idea- PvP Tourneys (Eliminates Pay-2-Win!)",
    "body": "For too long now has the Coliseum has been \"Disabled for renovations\". It is time we bring it back better than ever! Introducing...\n\nTHE WARRIOR'S GAUNTLET\n\n\"The Warrior's Gauntlet\" allows people to enjoy a PvP experience in Skyblock in a Balanced and Fair way. It is separated into 3 Leagues, being the Little League, Warrior's League, and Master's League. These Leagues all have their own rules and restrictions to balance out our favorite gameplay mechanics while also making PvP still a fun experience. I'll list the specifics here.\n\nThe Basics-\n\nWhen speaking to the Gladiator at Spawn, he will give you 2 options. The 1st will be \"Tourney\" while the 2nd will be \"Private Match\". Once selecting 1 of the 2 options, you will see 3 more. They will say \"Little League\", \"Warrior's League\", and \"Master's League\". Selecting one of these in the \"Tourney\" option will search for 7 more players with around the same leaderboard score as you in that specific League. Selecting one of these in the \"Private Match\" option will let you choose how many people are in a respected match, allowing you to create a tourney with the people in your party. Once in the match in any game mode, you will have 1 minute to choose 1 armor set that you have in your wardrobe to use for the match. You will NOT be able to interchange between armor sets. Once everyone is ready, a 5 minute timer will start and the battle will begin! May luck and skill be on your side!\n\nThe Leagues-\n\nThe different types of Leagues are very important towards the balancing of this PvP system. As I said before, each League has it's own restrictions and rules. I will go over them individually.\n\nLittle League\n\nPlayers can only use Common, Uncommon, and Rare Armor Sets and Weapons.\nEach Player's Fairy Souls are set to 0 and Talismans are disabled.\nZombie Swords and Power Orbs of ANY KIND are unusable.\nCritical Chance is set to 10%.\nEnderpearls, the Weird Tuba, and Grappling Hooks are unusable.\n\nThe Little League is meant to be for Beginners. We wouldn't want anyone with Lapis Armor up against someone in Superior, now would we? Now let's talk about the Warrior's League.\n\nWarrior's League\n\nPlayers can only use Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Epic Armor Sets and Weapons.\nEach Player's Fairy Souls are set to 100 and Talismans are disabled.\nThe Florid Zombie Sword, Mana Flux Power Orb, Overflux Power Orb, and Plasma Flux Power Orb are unusable.\nCritical Chance is set to 25%.\nEnderpearls and the Weird Tuba are unusable.\nThe Warrior's League is meant for Midgame Players. As you can see, restrictions have loosened quite a bit, but they aren't too bad. Onto the Master's League.\n\nMaster's League\n\nPlayer's can use any Rarity of Armor Sets and Weapons.\nEach Player's Fairy Souls are set to the MAX and Talismans are disabled (I do this because people might have more talismans than others, which provides an unfair advantage).\nNo Healing Items are unusable.\nCritical Chance is set to 50%.\nAll Items are usable.\nThe Master's League is meant for Endgame Players. Since they grinded so much for their gear, they should be allowed to use it.\n\nThe Leaderboards & Rewards-\n\nOf course, no good PvP game mode on Hypixel doesn't give rewards, so I set up some rewards for each and every League!\n\nStatic Rewards\n\nCoins |1k- Top 100,000|, |10k- Top 75,000|, |50k- Top 50,000|, |100k- Top 25,000|, |250k- Top 10,000|, |500k-Top 5,000|, |1m- Top 1,000|, |2.5m- 3rd Place|, |5m- 2nd Place|, |10m- 1st Place|\nBadge Talismans |Wooden (Common)- Top 100,000|, |Copper (Uncommon)- Top 50,000|, |Silver (Rare)- Top 25,000|, |Gold (Epic)- Top 10,000|, |Platinum (Legendary)- Top 5,000|\n\nLittle League Rewards\n\nNaive Shard (Rare) |1 Shard- Top 100,000|, |2 Shards- Top 75,000|, |3 Shards- Top 50,000|\nNaive Warrior's Blade (Rare) |+100 Atk, +80 Strength, +50 Critical Damage, 150 Intelligence, Ability: Beginner's Promise (For 3 seconds, your hits will deal 25% more Damage.

You see, Skyblock's economy is different from the real life market. To put this simply, let's go back to the beginning of skyblock when the ember rods dwelled in hands of the rich. At that time, how much did the ember rod cost? Well, it cost few hundred thousand coins. Now, back to the present. If we look at Ah, the most expensive weapon, such as the midas sword, livid dagger and the daedalus axe costs FEW HUNDRED MILLION coins. So, what happened? well during the 1 year and half of skyblock, the economy had too much coins. Players can make millions of coins easily and that is the key problem. You see, if the economy has too much money, the value of money will drop. This is called an inflation. Currently, skyblock is at an all time high inflation and what matters more is that ITS GOING TO GET EVEN WORSE as players make more and more money. So, here is what i propose. We need to increase the value of coins. Whether that is by making money making harder or just decrease the amount of money in market."

    "body": "Okay, over the past days I have had some ideas to add to skyblock and I want to share them with you all!\n\nUltimate Enchants:\n1. Unbreakable (Craftable):\nUnbreakable could be an Ultimate that reduces durability damage a dungeon item takes. It would go up to 5 levels like every other Ultimate. Yes, it should be craftable. It would be 32 enchanted obsidian around 64 enchanted paper, however this gives you the 2nd level of the item. It would be the last collection in the obsidian collection. The Unbreakable 1-5 enchants should also be found in dungeons 1-6. F1 could give Unbreakable 1, F2 could give Unbreakable 1-2, F3 could give Unbreakable 2-3, F4 could give Unbreakable 3-4, and etc. \n\n2. Length (Not Craftable)\nLength would be an Ultimate that adds slight reach to an item. Each Length level adds .5 blocks of reach. This also goes to level 5. You can find them in floors 3-6. F3 is Length 1, F4 is Length 2, F5 is Length 3-4, F6 is Length 4-5.\n\nItems:\nSo, we can all agree that the nether rack collection is lacking, right? Well, this idea adds 5 brand new items. The first is enchanted nether rack which is unlocked at 1.5k collection. This is worthless, but is used to craft the next item, enchanted nether bricks(5k collection). Again useless, but is used to make enchanted nether brick blocks(10k collection). This item IS useful as it crafts the frying pan (20k collection). I am not sure the stats of this weapon, but I know that it should have a variant at 100k collection called burning frying pan.\n\nTell me what you think! (also what should the frying pan do?)"

But I spent hours and made my friend do it too, foraging combat mining minions talismans. It was stressful, the days literally felt shorter, it would get really hot and I didn\u2019t even feel excitement when logging on, then my friend got tired and slowly drifted to other games, when alpha was released he was gone, but I wanted to progress and show him that we could still have fun, but he stopped responding to me. I think he got sick of seeing my texts, and I didn\u2019t even feel my arms anymore I would play 12 hours a day non stop, it hurt to get out of that position I would play in, so I decided to take a break focus on school but after 30 mins away from skyblock it just got really hot and I couldn\u2019t even think properly, I\u2019m not kidding I literally had to buy an extra fan to cool me down, as soon as I got back on skyblock I immediately started thinking of prices of items and how much of each slayer you should do during what time of day I thought of how many resources a coal minion could make in a month and I started to play vanilla and I froze for 5 mins trying to find out where the stupid menu was, and I also sit with my legs folded on top of my desk with my back grinding against my chair like this -> (\nSo my legs hurt like **** PLEASE HELP ME.

    "body": "The General Idea of\nAURAS\nAuras are like pets but give you extra dungeon abilities, or extra stat boosts in general, they also come with cool particle effects!\nAura types can vary between the drops from many different types of mobs and skill types.\nAura Types;\nFarming Auras\nForaging Auras\nAlchemy Auras\nDungeon Auras\nCombat Auras\nMining Auras\n& MORE SOON\n\n*DISCLAIMER*\n-NONE OF THE AURA ABILITIES ARE FINAL-\n\u200b Where Do I Access my Auras?\nAuras should be located just below collections and to \nthe pet menu's left side.\n\nfrom there, you can choose your varieties of auras!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Does the GUI Look Like?\nSimilar to the pets menu, The Aura menu has different\nsettings on how you want your auras displayed, and\neventually after this thread is finished, ill work on a \nsetting where ranked players can change the way\nthe particles behave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre There Any Settings?\nYes,\nyou can choose from making your\naura particles visible or invisible here;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Aura Drop Chances\nCommon : 1.5%\nUncommon : 0.5%\nRare : 0.2%\nEpic : 0.12%\nLegendary : 0.09%\nMythic : 0.01%\nim ****ty at math so i just made these numbers up\n\n\n\n\n Where To Get Auras\nAuras can be obtained in many ways, the easiest\nway is obtaining them from a new npc, Aurora\n\n\n\n\n(feel free to simp if you'd like)\nAn example of her GUI would look a little like this;\n\n\n\nMost Auras will be craftable.\ni.e the foraging, some alchemy, mining, combat, and farming auras will be crafted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I Craft Auras?\nThere are 2 ways to craft auras,\ncraft with a normal Aura Crystal\n\n\n\n\nEnchanted Diamonds 128x\nCrystal Fragments 192x\nEnchanted Quartz Block 12x\n\nor use a Weaker Aura Crystal\n\n\n\n\nEnchanted Diamonds 64x\nCrystal Fragments 96x\nEnchanted Quartz Block 6x\n\n\n\n\n Examples of Auras\nalthough this idea is in ways, similar to pets, it adds a cosmetic\naspect to it, different of how pets are. Of course, ranked players\nwill not be able to have exclusive access to auras at all.\n\nhopefully the only thing that should be exclusive to ranked\nplayers is the way the particles behave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i.e having the particles in a swirl pattern or static pattern)\n\n*NOT FINAL*\n\n\n\nmore aura examples coming soon if theres positive feedback.\n\n\n\nI would appreciate it greatly if you dropped a \"creative\" rating if you enjoyed or hope to see this implemented."

Well I think a good idea to encourage people to install this so called app in order to get a reminder before a certain event starts or you can choose a certain event on a certain skyblock day. Also you can add different features for the app as well including your skyblock profile featuring skills, minions, collections, etc. similar to sky.lea or sky.shiyu, also you can add a news tab for game updates, announcements, bug fix's, etc. and you also have the idea that started this forum, the event calendar. It'll first show the current skyblock month along with the current day and what events are occurring. EX: Early August 12th, Spooky Event in 1h 24m, Season Of Jerry in 12h 5m) you also have an option to set a reminder for that certain event. You can also see the other days and what events are occurring then. I think implementing this app will help encourage people to play and also give them a spark of joy by getting that thought you could've missed it without the reminder, thank you for your time."

Well, there's a ultimate enchant you can put on swords, but not rods, that increases your sea creature chance with the right pet - the chimera enchantment. With a max level dolphin, granting +5 scc, and a washed up souvenir, adding +5 scc to the pet, a Shredder with Chimera 5 grants +10 scc. That's 3 more than ROTS.\nOf course, you're paying like 100 million for +3% chance to get a rare sea creature. But you are playing Hypixel Skyblock, so..."

    "title": "Limit the daily available playtime in The Dragon's Nest (Read before you scream.)",
    "body": "The Dragon\u2019s Nest is a land void of happiness. It is full of despair, anger, sadness, addiction, and hopelessness. Every day, people waste hours upon hours of their lives sweating the dragon\u2019s nest, desperately seeking anything that can get them further ahead in the game, even if it means hurting other people in the process.\n\nI think something seriously needs to happen to the dragon\u2019s nest in terms of allowed playtime in it. There\u2019s no way that it can keep going on the way it is without there being serious consequences to kids in real life. This addiction that most have to grinding Zealots in the Dragon\u2019s Nest is affecting their lives in really bad ways. Lots of them purposefully miss online classes just to partake in it. Increasing anger over stolen kills, slowly developing depression from the absolute nothing that it brings to someone\u2019s emotional and mental health state, etc.\n\nMy proposal is to introduce a time limit per day for players when it comes to the Dragon\u2019s Nest. This is the only way that I can see any of this being fixed. Make no mistake, I\u2019m extremely aware of how unpopular this is gonna be to a lot of people. I realize that I will likely be called very bad names by several people for me even thinking to suggest this, but I think it\u2019s crucial that it be brought up.\n\n2 different 3 hour spans a day, the Dragon\u2019s Nest would be open to all players, 3 hours in the morning, and 3 hours in the evening/night time, to hopefully cater to multiple time zones across the world, and to also allow most kids to be able to play without interrupting their online classes, or in person classes.\n\nI think by introducing this limited playtime, it would turn into sort of a Grinch Simulator effect, where people can actually have fun in the Dragon\u2019s Nest, knowing that they only get a limited amount in it per day. I think the hostile atmosphere will be dramatically less, as you won\u2019t get anyone who\u2019s been in there the past 15 hours no sleep, and I think that it will shine the spotlight on more areas of Skyblock that most players probably might not be familiar with, like Dungeons and Farming and Revenants, etc.\n\nNow, keep in mind, this would apply to the Dragon\u2019s Nest ONLY. The End Island as a whole will still be open at all times. That means you don\u2019t have to worry about not being able to grind pets, combat levels, etc. Just the Dragon\u2019s Nest, and more specifically, the Eyes.\n\nNow, on top of this, these are the changes I propose happen to the Dragon\u2019s Nest as a whole to hopefully counter some of the unavoidable changes that would happen with this being added.\n\n1: Make Zealots spawn more frequently and often. \n-By increasing zealot rates drastically during the time the nest would be open, that will hopefully make eyes easier to get during the limited time, and hopefully counter out any economic change that would be brought forward by the nest being closed for most of the day.\n\n2: Minimum player number of 10-15 per lobby.\n-This one might be harder from a technical side, since this would mean more servers would be needed, but I think it could potentially be done.\n\n3: Damage Cap on Dragons.\n-This one simply has to happen. It\u2019s unacceptable that players can do 16 million damage to dragons in 10 seconds. Have a 5 million damage cap, and everyone that reaches it has the same chance at winning some cool items. Make it more encouraging and welcoming for everyone.\n\n\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts, reactions, and concerns. I\u2019ll try to respond to as many as I can.\n\n\nEDIT: RESPONDING TO FREQUENTLY BROUGHT UP POINTS\n\nSo it\u2019s been a hot minute since I posted this thread. A lot of responses have come in, and I wanted to say how pleasantly surprised I was at the reception to this thread. I was prepared for so many more dislikes, hate posts, attacking posts, etc.\n\nNot only have there been a lot of supportive responses, but even the disagreement responses have been, for the most part, non aggressive, and actually explaining their reasoning for why they don\u2019t like it, and I\u2019m really grateful that we can have this discussion without any of that toxicity coming between us. I\u2019ve seen some meme responses, non helpful responses, and attacks still, but that number is so far less what I thought it was gonna be.\n\nNow, I want to try to respond to some of the majorly favorite points people are beginning up as best as I can. Keep in mind that I do not play this game for progression reasons. I play it for fun and enjoyment, and that may affect the way I see things, which may convince you guys to see me as \u201cdumb\u201d or \u201can idiot\u201d or \u201cout of your mind.\u201d and that\u2019s ok, as long as you\u2019re respectful about it.\n\n\n*People will sweat way more knowing they have a limited amount of time to grind in the End.\n\n-This is what I hope the more frequent zealot spawns and the lesser number of players on islands will help to counter. I think the thing now is that there are too few zealots and too many players per island. If we tweak those things, it shouldn\u2019t really change much if some people are a little more sweaty, cause the more frequent zealot spawns and less players should evenly balance that out.\n\n\n*Kids will have to specifically play at a certain time, meaning they actually will miss things and it will have the opposite effect.\n\nNot really, at least I don\u2019t think. Cause with those 6 hours that you\u2019d have in Dragon\u2019s Nest, that still leaves you with 18 hours left in the day, Let\u2019s assume you sleep about 8 hours a day, that\u2019s still 10 hours that you have to work on other things in real life that you can do worry free. If you need to schedule your day around the dragon\u2019s nest being open at a specific time, and you\u2019re using your other time to do school work and hang out with your family and such, I think that ends up working out much better for you then simply being online the entire day in the dragon nest.\n\nRegarding \u201cKids will still miss their classes\u201d I tried to pick the times that are most likely to occur when most kids are not in a class. My specific times that I don\u2019t think I mentioned in the thread were 4-7 PM EST and 4-7 AM EST, before most school starts, and after most school ends. Of course, there\u2019s never gonna be a perfect timespan where every single kid doesn\u2019t have class and is free for 3 hours straight, so I always knew this was gonna be a hard one to find a perfect thing for. I think those times I picked will be the best.\n\n\n*Hypixel should not be the ones to limit playtime, it should be their parents.\n\n-Unfortunately, we\u2019re in a time where parents aren\u2019t really doing such a great job. If it were the case, then I definitely wouldn\u2019t have to suggest it, but here we are. People are right when they say it is not Hypixel\u2019s responsibility to keep track of how long kids are playing online, but I think the server can set a good example for other online communities, and maybe even win more parent support for doing it.\n\n\nI think those are the big 3. I\u2019ll keep reading to find more."

    "body": "Ok so there\u2019s this cool game called castle crashers, and it has some cool stuff that could be added to hypixel skyblock.\n\nnew magic spells that doesn\u2019t need a sword to use, just you.\n\nyou can click on the menu, and choose a carachter for the rest of your game. If new profile then it will bring it up first thing.\n\nIce: ice type character, magic attack will be ice throw in in front of you which deals damage and freezes enemies for X seconds (scales up)\nFire: fire in front of you, will burn mobs over time and immediate damage will be X ( scales up) \nred guy (idk man): electricity type carachter, will stun mobs and deal damage, but stunned mobs can still damage you.\nThis uses up mana. \nNow how does damage scales up? New skill called magic:\nGain magic xp for damage you deal with magic.\nAs it scales up it gives you more ability damage, which also affects your magic (not just weapon abilities)\nAlso as it scales up your damage dealt with magic. (Only magic, not weapon abilit(Ability damage is a real thing in skyblock ok)\n\n\nAs you get morelevels, you can use more spells. To use your spell it can be like M or something, and then other spells could be M and Space.\n\nOk add it thanks \n\nnot sure if this has already been suggested"

    "title": "Skyblock in D&D(1)",
    "body": "Hi everyone, SnowMinionT11 here, and I've decided to make Dungeons and Dragons items for skyblock, corresponding as best as I can. Let's start.\nSuperior Dragon Armor is going to be based off of Mithral Scale Mail. This mimics a dragons scales. Ordinarily, this would hinder movement, but Superior doesn't do that in game, so we're using mithral. Mithral armor removes the movement and dexterity penalties for wearing heavy or medium armor. We're going to give it a buff to AC as well, and bonus on ability checks for the set bonus.\nSo our final stats are:\nSuperior Dragon Armor: Legendary Armor\nAC 17\n+2 to ability checks.\nAll around, good, and viable for every class! \nVoodoo Doll:\nInterestingly, voodoo dolls already exist in DND as random trinkets. Let's try something else.\n\nAs a bonus action, you may trigger this doll while it is in your hand. If you do, pick an enemy up to 120 feet away that you can see. That target must make a DC 18 dexterity save. On a hit, 8 magical arrows appear around the target. Each arrow deals 1d8 damage initially and deals 8d4 force damage per round for 5 rounds. On a miss, the target must make a DC 10 wisdom save or become frightened for 1 round. This doll has 15 charges that reset after you take a long rest.\n\nPretty nasty overall. The fear is because, well, magic arrows materializing around you trying to impale you is happening.\n\nSilent Death:\nThis seems like something good for rogues, so I'll heavily nerf this to prevent a complete massacre.\n\nSilent Death:Rare Shortsword\nPrerequisites: Assasin Rogue Subclass\nAs a move action, you may disappear into the Shadowfell. The next round, you appear behind your opponent in an empty space, or if there is no empty space, the target is pushed. Using this ability grants combat advantage, and allows you to add 1d8 to your next attack on any attacks this round. If the target is pushed, you do not get combat advantage.\n\nWhat do you guys want to see?"

If you know anything about what happened, keep it to yourself, no matter how important you think it is. Both of us are sick of this fighting, and we've worked out a compromise that we're both fine with. All I ask from the rest of you is to not send hate towards either of us for any reason. Toxicity over this kind of stuff tends to get out of hand quickly if not put to a halt, and death threats of any kind over a block game are a bit much.\n\nWe both know our errors, and my only wish is for this to be resolved peacefully.\n\nI hope you all understand,\n- Hypernova642"

    "title": "Suggested Endermite Pet Rework",
    "body": "Endermite Pet is pretty useless now.\n\nHere are its current stats at level 100 (screen shot from the wiki):\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the first perk is useless:\n1. No one mines end stone unless it is during the mining event.\n2. If they do mine during the mining event they would be using a silverfish pet for more mining xp as the mining event doubles mining xp on public islands.\n\nWhy the second perk is useless:\n1. Sacks are cheaper than crafting this pet.\n2. Sacks do not have to be leveled up, so selling ender pearls from a sack will make as much money per ender pearl as a decently leveled endermite pet.\n3. Everyone else uses Sacks, so you cannot pick up ender pearls on the ground very often (this makes the second change this pet got a hard nerf).\n\nWhy the third perk is useless:\n1. Everyone grinding zealots is likely already using a God Potion and has hit Max Speed already.\n\n\n\nMy suggestions for a rework:\n(These are probably not very balanced but I tried)\n(Level 100 Legendary)\n\nBase Stats:\n+100 intelligence (+1 per level)\n+20 speed (+1 every 5 levels/+0.2 per level)\n\nWhy extra speed - Endermites are small and why not.\n\n1st perk:\n\nEndermite Friend: You can no longer attack endermites, and they will not target you. (Does not upgrade per level)\n\nWhy this perk - Endermites are annoying to hit.\n\n2nd perk:\n\nPearl Finder: Gain +50% chance (+1% chance every 2 levels/+0.5% chance per level) to get 100% more pearls (2x) when you kill an enderman or zealot.\n\nWhy this perk - keeps the original intention of the pet, which is to get more money from endermen/zealots while you are grinding. The difference is that this perk works with a sack while the current perk works against a sack. (This perk may need a nerf).\n\n3rd perk:\n\nZealot Hunter: Gain 10% more damage to zealots (+1% every 10 levels/+0.1% per level). After killing a zealot, gain 25 speed (+1 every 4 levels/+0.25 per level)(increases speed cap by amount given), 10 strength (+1 every 10 levels/+0.1 per level), 20 intelligence(+1 every 5 levels/+0.2 per level), and jump boost 4 for 20 seconds.\n\nWhy this perk - This pet can be useful for helping newer players kill zealots, or older players who don't want to use a god potion. (This perk may need a nerf).\n\n\n\nI feel these perks would buff the endermite pet to be more useful in the current state of the game.\n\n\nAdditional idea: Pet item to make endermite pet mythic rarity\n\nShiny Green Orb\n\nPossible Drops (ideas):\n\n1. RNG drop from Special Zealots (like 1/250 or something)\n\n2.Drop from Old Dragons.\n\nAdds 4th perk:\n\nPrecious Pearls:\n\nIncrease Pearl Finder pearl chance to 100% and increase the amount of pearls to 200% more pearls.\nUpon getting an Enchanted Ender Pearl as a rare drop, you will gain an additional 20 coins. For an Enchanted Eye of Ender, you will gain an additional 350 coins. (This does not consume the Enchanted Ender Pearl or Enchanted Eye of Ender).\n\n\n\nThis probably isn't balanced, but this pet was so useful and good on release, then they nerfed him twice, and added new stuff that made him more useless and I want it to be useful again.\n\nIf you have any suggestions let me know."

There are many better things to do with your life. To those who grind Skyblock a huge amount, I want to say something to you specifically: spend a day without Skyblock. Spend time with your friends and family. Maybe do some writing or drawing and bring out your creative side. Maybe even get a boyfriend/girlfriend to spend time with. ANnything to help you not waste so much time on Skyblock.\nThank you for reading this."

Those 20 sell for approximately 100-120k coins. Then you get a Green gift. Which is worth around 10K Coins. That's an easy 1-130k+ Coins from less than 10 minutes of work! (and you have fun while making money!) You can also use the gifts to try and get a Snow Minion!\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nChicken Race *NOTE* You can only do this once!\nDuring the event, there is a big hill, not the volcano, it's the one behind the bank. Go on top of it and towards one of the sides you should see Gulliver The Chicken. Do the chicken race and you will get a Gift Compass (Worth 20-50K Coins!, a Red Gift (Worth 40k+ COINS!), and a Frozen Chicken Talisman.\nThat is an Easy 80K+ (if you sell the gift compass which I don't recommend, you should keep it to find the gifts.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nSnow Minions\nFor this one, you will either need a snow minion or 5-700k+ Coins, This is more for people with more coins. \nStep One: Buy a Snow Minion (Preferably Tier 1.)\nStep Two: Buy 16 Stacks of Snow Blocks and 4 Stacks of Enchanted Snow Blocks.

I never do this one but I know you can catch Frosty, (Gives gifts),\nThe Grinch (gives gifts) and other fishing stuff. This is a biased opinion because I do not like fishing but you can for sure make a profit with it,\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThe Actual Event\nThis is probably, one of the best methods out of all. There is 4-5 Rounds, Each round Magma Cubes, and magma troops spawn, focus on the magma cubes. If you do enough damage, you get a lot of gifts, (7-10 White 7-10 Green 1-2 Red) Most of the time. Therefore, after 4-5 Rounds you will have 8-10 Red gifts, Which sell for 40k+ each, 30-40 Green gifts, Which sell for 10k+ each, and 30-40 white gifts, which sell for 5k+ each.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMy Conclusion is, There are many methods, and if you can try to do all of these, There are more that I did not list, but these are the easiest ones, in my opinion, feel free to share your money-making methods! And if this helped you, Please recommend more events for me to cover!\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n-Ehxo"

    "body": "I've made a video, but I'll write out the armor if you don't wanna watch it\n\n\n\n\nSo, this armor is quite cheap, but I still see people running around in strong with farmers boots or other armors in farmers boots. But with this armor it gives you 100 extra speed and no extra chromosomes. The main parts of the armor is a young helmet, obsidian chestplate (Full inventory of obsidian but 3 slots, 1 for sword, 1 for backpack, and one for being able to pick up summoning eye.) young dragon pants, and farmer boots (Level 19 or 20 farming recommended for best speed.) This will give you a constant of about 340% Speed, and will allow you to zoom past the other people. \n\nAnyway, if your super rich, and just do dragons, and don't need to know this, hope you have a good rest of forum scrolling <3"

Grasslands and plains greener than imaginable. The lush scenery of plants filled the world.\n\nEverywhere you looked, you could see beautiful colors everywhere. But, everything changed when the admins arrived.\n\n\u201cHey, Zeal!\u201d I called out to my friend. \u201cWhere ya heading?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot anywhere, in particular, just going to explore New Plain City,\u201d he said.\n\nI am known as Humphrey the Enderman. I live in the wonderful town of Plain City. Well, it\u2019s not a city. Plain City is the oldest and most sacred village throughout the world. It is ancient to the point where it was built even before my Grandpa Ernest was born! Recently, my dad and his construction workers have been building another city that is named: \u201cNew Plain City\u201d, in honor of Plain City.\n\nI lived under the same roof with Zeal, my childhood friend! His parents were kidnapped when he was born so my parents took him under their wing and adopted him. Although Zeal is shorter than me, he is way older and weaker. Compared to him, it makes me realize how short I am for my age...\n\nWell, for today, Zeal told me that he is going to find a job in New Plain City. I don\u2019t know if he will be able to find one because all the jobs are construction jobs. Mainly for the strong endermen.\n\n\u201cYou want me to come along? After all, it\u2019s your first job!\u201d\n\n\u201cYea sure, you can follow me,\u201d said Zeal.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Chapter 2 - Expansion\n\n\n\n\u201cAre we ready to begin Operation 45 6e 64 65 72 6d 61 6e?\u201d a voice said.\n\n\u201cBrother, I told you, we cannot rush the operation, because one small minuscule detail will render the portal useless...\u201d said another voice\n\n\u201cGrrr, just hurry up, we don\u2019t have all day.\u201d said the first voice impatiently.\n\n\u201cOkay! Okay! I\u2019m trying to get everything in commission as fast as possible so just shut your rainbow-colored mouth and keep still!\u201d\n\nBOOOOM!!\n\n\u201cIt worked! IT WORKED!!\u201d cried the first voice.\n\n\u201cGo go go! Just step inside the glowing ring and the portal will take us wherever we want to go.\u201d yelled the second voice.\n\n\u201cEhehehe\u2026 AHAHAHA! Operation 45 6e 64 65 72 6d 61 6e is now a success! \u201d\n\u201cHQ did you copy? I repeat, Operation 45 6e 64 65 72 6d 61 6e is a success!\u201d\n\nA whisper could be heard from the radio\u2026\n\n\u201cYes... We did. Hmmm? You said reports of strange purple insects?\u201d\n\n\u201cAhaha! Sanitize the insects! Sanitize it!\u201d the 2nd voice cackled.\n\nThis day was known as: \u201cThe Infiltration of The Portal\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, and there\u2019s more?\u201d questioned the 3rd voice.\n\nThe radio now could be heard announcing to the team:\n\u201cNext objective: Project Coloniam Deductam\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Chapter 3 - The Abduction\n\n\n\nAs I walked with Zeal to New Plain City, a sense of dread fell upon me.\nAll of my dad\u2019s workers were gone. The noisy work in progress city was dead silent.\n\n\u201cSomething weird is happening,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d mumbled Zeal as he kept on walking towards the city.\n\n\u201cThere are no workers here and I get the feeling someone is watching us.\u201d\n\nI turned around and took a look at my surroundings. Even without workers, New Plain City was an ultramodern city with functions I could only dream existed. Their underground tunnels connected every building, with houses twice the size of mine, and even floating gardens. New Plain City would become the greatest city that ever existed and would serve as a huge marketplace and entertainment area.\n\nWhile I was busy daydreaming, Zeal decided to head another way.\n\n\u201cHumphrey! Humphrey! Are you even listening? I\u2019m gonna go explore and see what places I can work at!\u201d snapped Zeal.\n\nI was fine with this as it meant I could investigate more on a mysterious phenomenon that I felt not too long ago. I headed over to what seemed like a park when suddenly, I heard a cry.\n\n\u201cHelp! Somebody help! I\u2019m getti--\u201d and then the voice was silent.\n\nI ran over to where the voice was and saw two strange men in black suits and masks. One was holding a hand over Zeal\u2019s mouth and the other was grabbing his hands and tying them behind his back.\n\n\u201cHey! Let go of my friend! You\u2019ve made a big mistake coming here!\u201d I yelled.\n\nThe two men looked at each other then nodded their heads in agreement and escaped. Haphazardly, the shorter man tripped over a wood bar and dropped to the floor. I took this opportunity and dove at him, ripping his mask and suit off.\n\nOne of the men punched me in the face knocking me to the ground. I groaned.\n\n\u201cZeal?\u201d\n\nI saw out of the corner of my eye that the two men had taken Zeal and were running away. Although I didn\u2019t know it at the time, that would be the last time I would see Zeal.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Chapter 4 - Lockdown\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s WHAT?\u201d said my panicking father.\n\u201cWe need to find these men right away! I will talk to the town elder and we will see what to do about this.\u201d\n\nI had just explained to my parents what happened to Zeal and the two men. My father was confident we could find the two men while my mother wept in her chair.\n\n\u201cH-h-he\u2019s gone?\u201d stammered my mother, not being able to handle the situation.\n\u201cHe was like a brother to you, not to mention your best friend. As your father said, we definitely must speak with the town Elder.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d I said volunteering.\n\n\u201cNo no, you must stay home and protect the village,\u201d replied my father.\n\n\u201cI was there when it happened so I need to be there with you to explain it!\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, we shall take you with us to the Elder.\u201d said my mother, wiping a tear from her eye.\n\nWe stepped out of our house and walked across to the other side of town to the Elder\u2019s house.\n\n*Knock knock knock*\n\n*A door could be heard being opened.*\n\n\u201cI know what happened last night.\u201d the Elder stated.\n\n\u201cBut, how? You weren\u2019t there,\u201d I said, confusingly.\n\n\u201cI know a lot and I see a lot, which is why I am the Town Elder,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Elder then asked me to leave and spoke with my parents privately.\n\nAfter waiting a while, my parents came out of the building. They told me that the Elder had started a lockdown and curfew. From now on, we would have to stay inside the house for 1 hour after dusk. We could also only go outside if it was an emergency. Guards were surrounding the vicinity of the residency to establish security.\n\nI grumbled at the news of this but I knew it was for the best.\n\nAt dusk, I went inside the house and sat down reminiscing about the series of events that led up to this moment. If only I had stayed with Zeal moments before he was kidnapped...\n\n*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK!*\n\nThere was a series of knocks at the door.\n\nI was confused because there should\u2019ve been guards out there. I slowly opened the door and right when I could see through the gap between the door, two sets of hands grabbed me and pulled me outside. It was the two men. I cried out in pain as they twisted my arm.\n\nThe man with the visor covered my mouth, preventing any sound from escaping. The last thing I saw before passing out was the guard in front of our house, with his shattered helmet and his limp body.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Chapter 5 - Camp\n\n\n\nI woke up in a dark room with my legs and arms bound. My vision was hazy.\n\nWhere am I? I thought.\n\nThen I recalled what had happened.\n\nI was dragged away by 2 people in white suits. Zeal was taken on the same day. All the construction workers were gone. There was a lockdown. All these thoughts rushed to my head, as a person came approaching me.\n\n\u201cLet me go! Where\u2019s Zeal?!\u201d I demanded.\n\n\u201cZeal... Hmmm, isn\u2019t that the guy that we took at the construction site?\u201d he said, turning around.\n\n\u201cApparently...\u201d replied the man with the visor and white suit.\n\nThe men walked around and inspected me.\nThey poked at my small arms with a stick. I flinched every time they got near my neck.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just like the other one,\u201d the second man stated.\n\nThey unbound my arms and pinned them behind my back. Then with a *click*, they locked my hands together with strange black material. They forced me to walk into a room with bars surrounding it. After locking me in, they strolled away.\n\nThey started speaking and I pressed my ear against the wall. I made out only a few words.\n\n\u201cinvade\u2026.population...Plain\u201d\n\nI stopped at that. Population, invasion, Plain, then something in my head clicked. They were going to invade Plain City! Oh no, this was bad. Really Bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Chapter 6 - The Invasion\n\n\n\nI peeked out of my cell and saw hundreds of soldiers marching outside the window.\nMany of them seemed to wield diamond hoes. They also wore diamond chest plates and boots. Every step sounded like a thousand explosions and my ears were ringing.\n\n\u201cSurrender now or face our wrath, we will not hold back!\u201d they chanted, \u201cSurrender now or face our wrath, we will not hold back!\u201d\n\nIt was almost like they were made to only say that. After a while, my ears blocked out the chants. If this army was going to invade Plain City, the guards there stood no chance.\n\nI knew that something must be done.\nWhat was the point of staying in my cell and wasting my time?\n\nWait, they haven\u2019t emptied my pockets.\nI remembered that I brought my pencil for note-taking like usual.\nIt seems like there is a lock as well, securing the door to my cell!\n\nWithout any hesitation, I attempted to pick the lock, with little hopes of unlocking it.\n\nClick!\n\nI never imagined that a pencil would be successful in unlocking a lock.\n\nThe security alarms rang.\n\u201cStop right there, prisoner!\u201d\n\nI paid them no attention as the last of the soldiers advanced through the building and into the plains.\n\n\u201cI have to run...\u201d I thought to myself\u2026\n\nI must warn Plain City... \nI must make haste\u2026\n\nHowever, as I ran through the prison, I noticed some strange incubators.\n\nThere was a sign that read: \u201dProject 45 6e 64 65 72 6d 61 6e\u201d\n\nAmong the tanks, a person just like me was incubated\u2026\n\nI shuddered at the thought of me becoming like the person\u2026\n\nI tried to hide as a phone in a nearby room rang.\n\n\u201cYes? I see. We shall begin the operation. Prepare the Mass Transit System now.\u201d\n\nHave they already arrived at Plain City?\nHow do they even cover such a long distance in a short period?\n\nHeavy footsteps resounded out of the room.\nThe person in a white suit with a helmet walked out the room and towards the exit, carrying a radio...\n\nI heard him cackling while answering the radio saying:\n\u201cAhahaha! Start the Mass Transit System.\u201d\n\nI watched in horror as the sky turned purple.\n\nHe noticed me and with an evil laugh said:\n\u201cYou see boy, you can\u2019t prevent this. After all, it's for the sake of our race and improving the sanitary conditions of our brethren.\u201d\n\nAs he concluded his sentence, a deep tremoring sound echoed through the air.\n\nAnd with a zap, the whole city disappeared.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Chapter 7 - Operation 45 6e 64 65 72 6d 61 6e\n\n\n\nAfter Plain City disappeared, I was traumatized. What happened to everyone and everything inside of it? Were they dead? What about my parents? And the town Elder! I collapsed to the ground in a sob.\n\n\u201cNow let\u2019s get you back to your cell,\u201d said the man as he grabbed me by my arm and dragged me back to my cell, \u201cand this time we\u2019ll search you.\u201d\n\nThis time, I didn\u2019t fight back. I couldn\u2019t, I felt paralyzed. After seeing my home get erased from existence, I had no energy. I only felt sadness and grief.\n\nThey locked me into my cell again but this time, they took all my belongings and burned them. They also put a guard in front of my cell to make sure I didn\u2019t escape.\n\nAfter the second day, I lost track of time and everything began to blend. My sight became fuzzy and I became light-headed.\n\nThen, the guard said something that surprised me.\n\n\u201cThe master wishes to talk to you,\u201d he said in a scraggly voice.\n\nHe walked into my cell and tied my hands together again with the black material and walked me into a room with all black walls. There was a very grand dark oak table and at the very end sat a man wearing the white suit and helmet.\n\n\u201cTell me, have you heard about Operation 45 6e 64 65 72 6d 61 6e?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cUhhh, no what\u2019s that?\u201d I lied.\n\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019m that stupid? I can tell when you\u2019re lying,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnyway, Operation 45 6e 64 65 72 61 6e is about rebuilding that wretched town, the one you guys call Plain City, and reconstructing the species of endermen!\u201d he said, an evil smile across his face.\n\n\u201cYou see, we\u2019ve already started the process and there's nothing you can do to stop it!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen those incubator tanks, you\u2019ve seen the endermen floating inside of them. Those hideous excuses for endermen are going to be changed, transformed into a bigger, stronger, and more powerful species,\u201d he said.\n\nHe walked over to the other side of the table where I sat, grabbed my neck, and dragged me with him. I could barely breathe. He brought me to a room with a bunch of strange redstone devices and looked me in the eye.\n\n\u201cYou see this? This is how we are going to change your species, your pathetic species will be reborn, rebuilt, and remade into the strongest beings the world has ever seen!\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother!\u201d another voice called from across the hallway, \u201cWhere are you? Oh there you are, I see you are giving our \u201cguest\u201d a tour.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuiet fool, leave me alone,\u201d the man with the helmet said.\n\n\u201cWhere are my parents, where is my family, WHERE IS THE REST OF PLAIN CITY?\u201d I shouted.\n\n\u201cI knew you were going to say that,\u201d he said, \u201cCome, follow me.\u201d\n\nHe brought me down a flight of stairs and led me into a dark hallway. There were dozens if not hundreds of rooms, each of them with an iron door and a guard guarding them. In each cell was someone from Plain City. I saw them stare at me with tears, begging for me to rescue them but we all knew there was nothing I could do.\n\nMy hands were still bound behind my back and even if they weren\u2019t, the guards outnumbered me 50 to 1. The man then led me back up the stairs into the room with the incubation chambers.\n\n\u201cOnce these endermen come in contact with oxygen, they will begin the evolution process and become enhanced endermen!\u201d he said with a cackle.\n\nThen, he opened one of the tanks full of green liquid. Surprisingly, the liquid didn\u2019t flow out like other liquids. The enderman inside of the tank stumbled out with a dazed look.\n\n\u201cWhere am-,\u201d he paused and fell.\n\n\u201cIs he okay?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s fine, my state of the art scientists perfected the formula a thousand times!\u201d he boasted.\n\nThen, the enderman stood up straight and his limbs began to grow. His arms doubled and his height tripled. He seems a lot bulkier than before.\n\nThe former enderman kneeled and said in a monotone voice, \u201cIt is my pleasure to serve you, O Great One.\u201d\n\n\u201cRise,\u201d said the man in the white suit, \u201cso I may take a better look at you.\u201d\n\nThe enderman stood up and walked closer. Then, the man in the white suit grabbed my arm and compared it to the other enderman\u2019s. His arm was like a steel bar while mine was like a noodle.\n\n\u201cNow, we shall repeat this process and make every enderman better!\u201d he said.\n\nI heard the sound of liquids rushing in and people screaming. My brethren! I ripped myself out of his grip and went dashing towards the room that held the people of Plain City.\n\nIt was too late.\n\nBy the time I got there, several rooms were filled with a green liquid and they didn\u2019t seem to be able to break free. A tear rolled down my face as guards ran up to me and tackled me to the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Chapter 8 - The Origin of Zealots\n\n\n\nError! Error! Error!\n\nAn alarm blared as the rooms got full of the liquid,\n\nError! Error! Problem X93nk2! Initiating self-destruction sequence!\n\n\u201cNooooo!\u201d cried the man in the white suit.\nHe fell to his knees clenching his suit, \u201cYou, you ruined everything!\u201d\n\nI would\u2019ve felt pretty happy if it weren\u2019t for the fact that the alarm said \u201cInitiating self-destruction sequence!\u201d I looked over and saw a blinking red light.\n\nBOOM!\n\nIn every room, there was an explosion and the force knocked everyone down. The whole facility was on fire and it was a mad dash to escape. I kicked some of the guards in the face and ran out of the building. With the sight of this scene, I cried.\n\nMy family, my friends, everyone I knew, they\u2019re all gone, killed by the explosion...\n\nSuddenly, I heard a growl. It was the man in the white suit\u2019s brother. He gripped a sword so hard I thought it might break.\n\n\u201cYou monster! You destroyed the facility, killed your town, and ruined my brother\u2019s entire career!\u201d he snarled.\n\n\u201cWhat? No that\u2019s not what happened,\u201d I said but he wasn\u2019t listening.\n\nHe slashed me with his sword. He stabbed and swung his sword like a madman. The blade grazed my arm and almost hit my shoulder as I attempted to dodge the strike. I winced in pain.\n\nI grabbed a nearby stick and attempted to block some of his attacks. The stick was broken in the process but I was able to surprise him by hurling the remains of the stick and started to climb the tree. In confusion, he climbed after me.\n\nI jumped off and landed right on him. One could agree that it was a risky move as I almost skewered myself. I knocked him off the tree and snatched his sword along the way. After making sure he was unconscious, I escaped with the sword in my hand.\n\nThis tale is perhaps, a mystery, or even a tragedy.\nAnd with that, I conclude with a farewell...\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Afterwards\n\n\n\nAnd that my friends, is the origin of zealots. I decided to name them Zealots after my friend Zeal, one of the first stolen. Those few days still haunt me to this day but I have learned that the past is the past and there is no point in groveling for my city my ENTIRE life.\n\n\n\nThank you guys for reading this story! You might've been able to catch some Easter Eggs within the story. If you didn't notice them, they are in the spoiler below.\n\n\nSpoiler: Easter Eggs\n\n\n\n1. Operation 45 6e 64 65 72 6d 61 6e is hexadecimal for Operation Enderman\n2. The two characters that we have not been told the names of are actually Minikloon and Dctr. The main hint that the 1st character was Minikloon is when the 2nd character says \"Shut your rainbow-colored mouth\" which is a nod at Minikloon's skin. The main hint for Dctr wasn't so simple. We mentioned that the 2nd character, Dctr wanted to \"sanatize\" the insects. Also, we said that he had a helmet and Dctr's minecraft skin is an astronaut with, you guessed it, a helmet."

And I hope people find it annoying also\n\nThis is why I'm suggesting the completely optional \"You spawn it. You get it\" initiative. This setting, toggleable in the skyblock menu, completely prevents anyone from attacking the mob that you spawned, fished, whatever it may be. This allows you to:\n1. Secure all the drops through telekinesis which eliminates having to hope your mob was stolen near you\n2. Stops all stealing of combat XP from slayer bosses and their minibosses (probably even worse!), an issue I've seen many, many times in the spider's den. It's crazy to me how people can steal the combat XP you literally just paid for.\n3. Gives you the satisfaction of that potential rare drop jingle, whether that be from a special zealot or powerful mob.\n\nThis option will be in the settings menu of the skyblock menu. It is completely optional as people may want help with beating a t4 boss for example. And that's completely fine. However, I think this addition will give many players, like me, the independence they so long for as well as getting rid of the issues I mentioned previously\n\nThanks for reading, if you disagree please let me know your thoughts."

Given that he is a philsopher who is also lonely, I think it is safe to say that this person is extremely introverted. Introverts who spend a lot of time on the internet often are furries, so that is one point. \n\n2: Location: The most suspect piece of this puzzle that is the location of which the lonely philosopher chooses to reside. He lives in a tower of the ruins, however, it is suspect because of the sheer number of dogs living in the castle. And while it might be just because of the fantastic setting for thinkin gin the castle, you have to love dogs to live with them, and as a furry myself, I have to say that that is completely true. \n\n3: Choice of profession: The philosopher contemplates life for a living, and often those of whom choose to think end up in strange states. Perhaps that is why the lonely philosopher is there, contemplating life. He is a furry, and he loves it.\n\nI have taken an elective of psychology last year, and with all the knowledge that I accumalated over those 5 classes, I believe that it is safe to assume that the lonely philosopher is a furry."

Placing saplings was an intended feature.\n\nUnlike Ghast Farming, which was macroable, this was not. It took effort to build the farm, plant, and destroy the trees. I see no reason for the admins to remove this as it is has pretty much the exactly the same effect as a Replenish enchanted hoe had on farming.\n\nBring back Sapling Placement.\n\nEdit: I'm going to try to spread this as much as possible so there's a bigger possibility admins can see.\nMy message to admins: Please consider reversing your shadow nerf on sapling placement, it harms more people than you think, it invalidates hours of effort. A nerf would be better received.\n\nEdit two: I'm going to add suggestions for nerfs here so that maybe admins will reconsider adding it!\n@Sir_Bacon_2020 suggested to keep it in the game, but nerf the exp gain.\n@Kashapo suggested to not nerf the exp, but instead make the saplings grow slower.\n@Athyestic suggested that the trees grow according to the Terraria rules, such as: \" There must be at least three open tiles between two Saplings or only one will grow into a tree. \" so that there are not as many trees."

Now, you may be wondering if you were at my last thread, isn't this supposed to be a gold mine themed island? Well, yes, however, that island isn't even close to done because I have other clients who take priority. This seasonal one is only available for a short time, and was in the making well before even the planning stages for the... gold mine... themed one. But I should honestly start calling the \"gold mine themed one\" by what it really will be, a Dwarven Stronghold. \nEnough of the intro though, let's get right to it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this Fire-Sale, I will be selling unlimited copies of this build until Thanksgiving Day (November 26th!).This thread will be up for that amount of time, and once the time is up, that's it!

I made a minion storage for 24 minion slots, and ngl it's one of my best so far. I'll edit the image in later and cross this out.)\n\n\nI am selling each copy of this build for 7.5 million coins (after some feedback from the last sale about pricing!). I sell you the schematic, you still build it yourself.\n\nNo Copies Copies Sold Yet!\n\nTo buy this, please start a forum conversation with me! (I will be busy most of today (day this thread came out), but I will respond to all buy orders soon if not immediately!) Additionally, for anti-plagiarism, a list of people who have purchased this build will be provided after the sale is over. This way, if anyone copies the build for themselves (please don't! ), you can see who's supposed to have it.\n\n1. Be the first here!\n\nFinally, I just want to say that I've put in A LOT of effort into this, and the support I've been receiving has been really great! I would also like to say here that if you are interested in purchasing a custom schematic from me, I do accept commissions, however, as of writing this, I am very backed up on orders.\nPlease read this thread for all information concerning custom builds: https://hypixel.net/threads/schematic-shop-xtear\u2019s-island-designing-services.3373920/\n\nAnd, if you want to see my last seasonal sale,\n\n\n\n\n\n[FIRE-SALE] Exclusive Halloween Edition Island - OVER!\n\n\nATTENTION: FIRESALE OVER!

    "body": "I think many players are enjoying the new farming event rn. But do you know that farming actually get nerfed so hard after the event is released?\n\nSo from the patch notes, admins changed all the farming bonus from multiplicative to additive. And this change is an INSANE nerf assume that all bonuses are multiplicative before.\n\nQuick comparison here. For a maxed farming player b4 the patch, the max crop multiplier is 300%(farming 50) * 162.5%(harvesting 5) *125%(leg elephant) = 609.375% around 610% here(blessed reforge was **** b4 so I didn't count it). But for a maxed farming player rn, the max crop multiplier is 3.4(farming 60)+0.625(harvesting 5)+50%(leg elephant)+0.25(turbo V)+1.46(10mil collection tier 3 hoe)=623.5% + 2%*gold medals invested in the new perks.\n\nSo the new rate is slightly higher than the old one. But you have to spend tens of millions of coin to upgrade your gears and many hours to grind the extra 10 lvls and 10mil collection to barely surpass the original drop chance. And if you missed any of the new stuff, for example you don't have extra farming lvls, then you would only have 583.5% which is still lower than the original chance even though you have already maxed everything else. An even worse case is that assume someone didn't get anything from the new event. Then his drop chance will be lowered to 3+0.625+0.5 = 4.125 That's like a 30% nerf to drops\n\nSrsly why tf would the admins change the drop mechanism like this"

Its Fun, but not too OP. 2bh the shadow fury is really fun to use but it is basically just aote but more automatic lol. To balance being used with livid dagger though, make it so that you can't swap swords anymore. Or make it so you can, either way IDRC \n2. It would make shadow fury more relevant. Now there's a point in getting a more expensive sword than livid dagger that's harder too use and has less dps most of the time! \n3. The old ability messed with mana. If you had SA boots, it would regen 10 mana or something like that. Pretty pog, right? WRONG. IF you used crystal armor to recharge and then swapped to SA, the boots would reset your mana, meaning deleting over 1k mana. BRUH \n\n\nIMO This would be really fun, I would love to have 3 sec cooldown shadow fury. <3"

They also login during my sleep hours, so me doing a stakeout to find their spawn point is out of the question.\n\nMy options, and I don't have much: \n- Block everything with obby. Not permanent, they can just find some way to get a diamond pickaxe and mine right through.\n- Put everything into an ender chest. Also not permanent, I need an actual storage\n- Get a mod to help. Impossible. Mods are useless.\n\nSo that leads me here. I need some help guys. I probably don't have much time until they decide to lavacast my island or something."

(Note: you do not need to wear the hat at all times to get double the buff, only when claiming your cake buff)\nCrafting Recipe (I have a few ideas for the recipes):\n\nCrafting idea #1: You have to combine all 9 cakes in the crafting table for the hat\n\nCrafting idea #2 (I like this one the most) : They could add a new item called cake mix which you could have maybe a 1/50 chance of getting from claiming you cakes and you would use 9 to create the hat\n\nCrafting idea #3: This idea is kinda dumb and kinda too late to do but at Simon, there is a chance of getting the hat instead of the cake\n\nHope you guys like the idea, please tell me what you think"

Smells like a bug tbh, but could be just me being bad at 'coding'. This makes stuff like Collection Progress Bar and Midas' Sword only display one texture and look less fancy.\n\n\nComing Soon?\n\n\n\nSpoiler\n\n\n\nThe following might or might not be added in near feature:\n(Feel free to comment below if you want me to give priority to anything)\n- Items that will be added in future updates of SkyBlock\n- More visual displays for power on bows?\n- More visual displays for enchantments on armor?\n- ???\n\n\nChangelog & Info\n\n\nSpoiler\n\n\n\nList of all vanilla textures changed:\n(Unlike CIT (name-based textures for custom SkyBlock items), those should be overridden if you put another resource pack above this one in the Resource Packs menu. This is good so you can intentionally toggle or remove them)\n\n\nSpoiler\n\n\n\n- Health and Mob-food bars\n- Pumpkin and Melon stems\n- Villager Spawn Egg Color* (color.properties makes villager eggs white so I can color the Jerry Egg :S)\n- Mooshroom Spawn Egg Color*\n- Water Bottle\n- Awkward Potion\n\n\n\nChangelog\n\nv1.44-2 (Hotfix/\"Coldfix\") - Just two fixes or something to show that I'm still alive\n- Fixed Treacherous Shredder not casting\n- Attempted to make sure Stone Chestplate works because someone complained, but I didnt find the issue. If you're still having it in this version, tell me your mc version and complain below\n- Maybe fixed something else pretty tiny, I forgot\n\nv1.44 - Dungeon stuff\n- Added most dungeon items from the beta. Does not include dungeons GUI, might or might not be added in the future\n- Finished adding Adaptive Armor recently. Adaptive Armor made mostly by @8KCoffeeWizard\n- Some bugfixes from the beta. I'm hoping this is stable enough now to be the main version of the pack.\n- If this pack doesn't get updated anymore, it means I've quit SkyBlock after it became p2w\n\nv1.43 - Tarantula fix again, GUI improvements\n- Fixed Tarantula Armor again\n- Added Wardrobe icons\n- Added stat icons under Skyblock Menu > Your SkyBlock Profile (your head)\n- Added Pet Score Rewards icon\n- If I added anything else, I forgot\n\nv1.42 - Fixes, added most missing stuff\n- Spent like 1h fixing 3d weapon models in 1.15.

Tell me if you ever get pink potions in 1.13+\n\nv1.34 - Tons of icons, bit of other stuff, general improvements\n- Probably fixed Custom Potions in 1.14\n- Added Weights to \"good\" enchantment books, like Growth 6 and Sharpness 6.

Lava Bucket (except block ones that are impossible to add), added all talismans (like Experience Artifact and Crystals)\nv1.05 - Random bugfixes and internal improvements, added all fishing rods (crap, I forgot Shredder), Creeper Pants and Spiders' boots\nv1.04 - Fixed Magma Leggings icon being different than the model, fixed a major bug with enchantment displays on Lapis and Cactus armor, improved Blaze Chestplate texture\nv1.03 - Fixed Execute V not displaying, fixed Magma Bow, added Blaze and Growth armor main textures (enchantments may be added in the future).\nv1.02 - Fixed bugs caused by v0.6 SkyBlock and added textures for the new Telekinesis and Hot Potato\nv1.01 - Made it actually work in 1.8, lol\nv1.0 - Initial Release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVanilla+ SkyBlcok R.P. v1.44-2\n\n\nMediaFire is a simple to use free service that lets you put all your photos, documents, music, and video in a single place so you can access them anywhere and share them everywhere.\n\n\n\nwww.mediafire.com\n\n\n\n\n> > Download v1.44-2 for OptiFine L6 (or equivalent) < <\n\nIMPORTANT (HOW TO INSTALL and WARNINGS):\n- Requires latest OptiFine (with Custom Items and Random Mobs settings turned On)\n- Works in ALL Minecraft versions* except 1.15+ due to OptiFine being half-assed. Ignore the warning!\n*It will work on 1.15 when/if OptiFine fixes CIT packs. Not on my end.\n\n\"BUT MY PACK DOESN'T WORK\"\nTroubleshooting:\n\n\nSpoiler\n\n\n\nIf nothing works on the pack\n\nIgnore the \"Incompatible\" warning when activating the pack\nMake sure you have OptiFine\nMake sure you have Custom Items setting On (Video Settings > Quality)\nMake sure you have the resource pack in the right side of your resource packs list\nIf you are on 1.15, that's probably OptiFine's fault for being incomplete in that version\nIf horses look invisible (Caused by: 1.8.9 OptiFine L5+)\n\nThis is a \"major\" bug in OptiFine L5. Note that this bug causes your MC log files to be pretty big because of the missing texture spam, so you'll want to watch out.\nTo fix the bug, turn Random Mobs off or downgrade OptiFine to the i7 version. These are the only ways to fix it, sadly.\nIf items don't work in your hand or similar (Caused by: Orange's 1.7 Animations Mod)\n\nReplace Orange's 1.7 Animations with OldAnimationsMod and/or Fully remove it (disabling won't help)\nIf blocks/potions look pink&black or are all weirdly colored (Caused by: 1.8.9 OptiFine i7)\n\nIf it your potions like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate your OptiFine or download an older version of the pack\nIf using Badlion or similar (outdated optifine, not compatible with potions), download an older version of the pack\nIf custom dragons or mobs don't work\n\nTurn the \"Random Mobs\" setting on\nNote an OptiFine bug made me disable custom mobs in the non-i7 version of the resource pack. Might get fixed and re-enabled when optifine updates.\nIf bows or fishing rods don't pull/cast (Caused by: 1.8.9 OptiFine L5)\n\nUpgrade your OptiFine to L6! Otherwise:\nOptiFine bug :c can't do anything to fix it on that OptiFine version\nDowngrading your OptiFine will fix it but break custom Blocks and Potions instead\nIf rods lose their custom texture in third person (Caused by: OptiFine)\n\nAll or most versions of OptiFine seem to have this issue. Can't do much, currently. They should still work in first person, at least.\nIf emissive textures don't work (Caused by: wrong settings OR 1.8.9 OptiFine)\n\nTurn the \"Emissive Textures\" setting on\n1.8 OptiFine also currently does not support those on custom items\nIf something doesn't work in 1.13+\n\nMight be an actual bug with the pack, 1.13+ hasn't been very tested. Please report, I'm gradually fixing 1.13+.\n\n\n\n\n<My Resource Pack/Spreadsheet's Discord Server if you really want>"

Does anyone know what happened to it? \n\nFor a bit more context, the guy I brought it from forgot to add the zeros because he wanted to sell it for 1.312 mil. He then sent me a party invite and asked for it back, in which I said he could have it back for 700k. You can call me an a-hole if you want, but I wanted to keep it. I left the party and he sent another invite but I just ignored him. Is it possible he found a way to get it back?"

Ive been thinking about this idea for a while, and I feel it would give a use to the otherwise useless items poisonous potatoes and enchanted poisonous potatoes, these would be in either zombie or potato collection, zombie because they drop them and potato because obviously. Maybe also make it possible to plant poisonous potatoes that give a % chance to drop them or 100% chance since you currently can't farm poisonous potatoes as a plant. Just an idea, I hope its considered"

The last time i got on was when the century cake first was able to be grabbed. I hopped on grabbed it got a health cake and logged off. Today my coop messaged me on discord asking if i had all the coins still and if i could put them back. I was confused because i had logged out with no coins previously. I got on to see i had 60 mil in my purse and they had been taking money out from 4 hours ago. I have nothing in my inventory besides a green candy and a grapple and my armory had been basically cleaned out excluding a lapis set and an unstable set. My echest was completely cleaned out as well. I still had my pets and my other profiles had not been touched probably because they had a few hours of progress on them. As i was trying to figure out what had all been taken i got logged out again and my coop was still on. The hacker started trying to be me and said that he would hack the whole coop because he loots accounts and sells their items for money. I have changed my password and i just dont know if my coop is safe or if i can even get my armor or weapons back. I dont have any screenshots of my items before i got hacked because i thought it would never happen to me. I had maxxed AOTD and holy dragon armor with 5regen on every piece. it took me a while to get all the regen and the holy set so thats all i want if i can get any of my items. I am a healer in dungeons and when i do play this thats what i mainly play."

    "body": "I'm sure this idea has been posted multiple times before, and that im not the first person to think of this, but Imma post it anyway \n\nAs many of you know, the \"Wardrobe\" update came out a few months ago, letting you store armor sets in your nether star, so you could switch armor from anywhere at a click of a button without taking up any space in your inventory or ender chest. Well, I propose to you a most likely not very original idea but still one i want to make people aware about. The Inventory \"Wardrobe\"! It's the same concept as the wardrobe we currently have, storing armor sets and quickly switching to them without taking up any space, the only difference is that instead of it being armor sets you can switch between, its Inventory Layouts. As said, its the same concept as the armor wardrobe (multiple layouts, you get more depending on your rank), But with the Inventory Layout you get a 3 x 9 grid to place items/tools in, including the 1 x 9 at the bottom (hotbar). The reason i wanted to post this here is because i think it would save a lot of valuable time, as for example, if youre in a dungeon run but you have a mage set up instead of a different class. By a click of a button, youre ready to go, without having to leave a lobby because you maybe forgot an item or two. It could also be good for farm building, if youre tired of running from your island and back to the hub 10,000 times to get dirt, you can fill up your Layouts so it would require many less trips to the hub. (and yes, i know that we just got a farming update which makes it easier to build farms, but the traveling problem still remains)\n\nI hope you agree with me and this idea, and maybe if you share it to someone you know to spread awareness, it may be included in the game.\n\nThank you for your time \n\nEdit: If you have any ideas you would like to add to this concept, feel free to comment it"

    "title": "Economics of Snow Minions (Updated)",
    "body": "About two weeks ago, I made a thread on the Economics of Snow Minions. Click here to view it. As I am not completely well-versed in Skyblock, I made some mistakes and incorrect assumptions, most notably I assumed that:\n- Supply was infinite\n- Current prices of snow minions were stable\n\nAfter making the thread, several people noted that snow minion supply does exist, and that the price of them has been increasing in the recent past. I am making this thread to correct my mistakes and form a better judgment for the future of snow minions.\n\nI made a separate thread because I like to keep the old one as a record and show that I am not perfect and I don't know everything. I plan to make more of these types of threads across different gamemodes, but I will make sure to be more knowledgeable about the game prior to making a post about it.\n\nSo without further ado, here is the updated version of the economics of snow minions:\n\n\n\nCurrently, snow minions are fairly costly, especially for newer players. A tier 1 snow minion typically costs between 500,000 and 700,000 coins when traded between players.\n\nWhy is it so expensive?\nBecause supply is low and demand is high. Supply is low because the only way to create a new snow minion is by receiving it from a gift box. Demand is high because it is a profitable investment, so people want it.\n\nWhat will happen to its price?\nCurrently, the price of a snow minion is rising, possibly due to inflation. If inflation is the sole determinant of the rise in price, this means that the real value of the snow minion is still the same. However, inflation on Hypixel is not very high, which I will get to later, so there has to be another factor(s) involved. The only ways to raise real price levels are to increase demand or decrease supply. Supply is definitely increasing because I don't believe many people would be throwing their snow minions into the void. An increase in supply means that the quantity is increasing but the price is decreasing, so demand has to be exceeding supply. If my analysis is correct, demand for snow minions is increasing dramatically, probably because there is a greater supply and people are slowly getting richer, which leads to inflation. This trend will likely continue unless it naturally self-adjusts or the admins introduce fiscal policy.\n\nSelf-Adjustment?\nIn the short run, demand seems to increase faster than supply, moving the entire graph to the right overall, causing an increase in real GDP. However, as time passes, the economy will slowly adjust itself, since the snow minion economy is doing very well. Supply will continue to increase, meaning demand will slow down, since more people will own snow minions.\n\nFiscal Policy?\nFiscal policy is basically government intervention, or in this case, updates. New updates could cause positive or negative changes for snow minions. If a new minion is added that is better than a snow minion, the snow minion will devalue. If new items are added that are crafted with snow, the snow minion will increase in value, but if new items are added that are not crafted with snow, the snow minion will (potentially) devalue as other minions might increase in value. It is always a good idea to pay attention to updates and new features to understand the change on prices of any item.\n\nWhat about inflation?\nThere does seem to be a general increase in the GDP of the server. As players generally become more wealthy, they will be willing to spend more and purchase more prestigious, valuable, and expensive items. This causes the market value of certain normal goods to rise, making it more difficult for newer players to be able to progress. As a result, if the price of a snow minion raises nominally, newer players might not be able to purchase snow minions. This thread explains inflation in Skyblock and the issue surrounding it. He also provides some possible solutions to the inflation issue.\n\nConclusion\nIt is hard to tell what will happen to the price of snow minions. There are many ways to look at it, and I only provided a few. This isn't because I'm uneducated and don't know what I'm talking about, but because this is a specific situation being generalized by general economic concepts. Even real-life economists have hard times telling the direction of an economy (such as now during the COVID-19 pandemic) because economic activities are influenced by so many factors, causing it to be very unpredictable. The Skyblock economy does function similarly to a real economy, as it should - it is an economy that will generally follow economic principles and generalizations. I believe that the price of the snow minions will fall by a little bit, but not by much, because the inflation rate does not seem to be high, but it is there. Overall, more people will eventually own snow minions and can cause the depreciation in their value as a whole. My estimate is that a year from now, ceteris parabis, now minions will be worth about the same, more or less, since many factors that can equalize each other are at play.\n\nNote\nI might be completely wrong! Snow minions could increase to 2,000,000 coins in a year because of inflation, updates, or other factors. Or, they could depreciate to 100,000 coins because of low demand, updates, or other factors. It is unclear, but it still is an interesting topic worth noting. What do you think about this? Make sure to vote in the poll! Also, do you want me to make more real-life application threads for Skyblock?"

    "body": "Plenty of tanks have said that their class needs a re-work. That's surely true. But they also need new items--and, maybe more importantly, *fun* items. \n\nEvery class except tank and healer have some fun items: bonemerangs for archers, flower of truth and livid dagger for berserkers, and, well, almost every new item for mages. But unless I'm mistaken, there's no fun, tank-specific item. SkyBlock needs to change that!\n\nHere's one idea: Panther Armor. (It's a rip-off of Black Panther's skin in the MCU--but SkyBlock has no aversion to borrowing ideas from other universes, so I don't think that should be a problem.\n\nLike Black Panther's skin, the cool thing about Panther Armor is that it stores up energy, up to a certain point, every time its wearer gets hit. When the wearer decides to release this built-up energy, it would do a certain amount of damage to all of the mobs in a five-block radius, divided by the number of mobs in that radius. (If there were five mobs, the total amount of damage would be divided among those five; if there were only one, that mob would receive all the damage. A nice perk for yellow rooms, to take just one example.) \n\nThe damage cap would scale with the wearer's tank class level; as a rough starting point, let's say a level 30 tank could unleash 3m damage, a level 20 tank could unleash 2m damage, and so on. (The alternative would be to have the damage cap scale faster: 1m at level 10, 2m at level 15, 3m at level 20, and so on.) It should do enough damage that other classes immediately begin complaining about the need to balance the tank class. (Needless to say, only tanks should be allowed to wear it.)\n\nI think this would be a fun item for tanks to have, and it fits with their class-specifics (namely, they're the class that takes damage, and they're also a pretty thoughtful, strategically minded class). \n\nI would be interested to hear what tanks think of this. If nothing else, I would encourage tanks to offer suggestions about what would make their experience more fun!"

    "body": "So quite a bit ago, about 1-2 months or something, I came up with a idea, called Companions. They would fight alongside you, and you would give them weapons. I worked with @ImEmber and @imapuffer on this, but Ember left and Puffer just was there, so the project went nowhere. Back to the present. I wanted to make a idea megathread because clout it's fun and also clout. Wait... Merriam Webster says clout means a hit with the hand. Okay I don't want clout anymore\nBack to the idea and not on the thought of people hitting me. It would not be overpowered because the Companions, now renamed Allies, could only use specialized weapons from their own island. And you would have to Forge those weapons and also pay/help them to level the Allies up. Allies would be like Lost Adventurers, meaning they look like a player. They would be found in a new island, the Kingdom. (also imagine the absolute chaos if LAs added bhop to their cheat list)\nAdmins, please don't move this to Ideas and Feedback. That section kills threads\nSo!\nHere we gooooooooooooooo\n\nThere would be 3 classes of Allies. Warrior, Archer, and Brewer. The Warrior would stab stuff with swords, the Archer would shoot primal sticks with feathers and flint on different sides, and the Brewer splashes debuff and buff water bottles with stuff in them. The Warrior would focus on all around good stats, the Archer focuses on extreme single target damage and speed, but is very fragile. The Brewer focuses on bulk and uses potions for attack, defense, and support. Each class has 5 tiers. You must help them or give them items to level up their tier.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Archer\n\n\n\nThe Archers are the children of Elves and humans. Archers, through training and connecting, can harness their elf abilities. I chose elves because they are normally associated to bows in fiction. Think Lord of the Rings elves, not christmas elves. They live in the forests of the Kingdom Island, honing their aim. These are their tiers:\nApprentice Archer, Tier 1. Items needed to level up: 32 enchanted bread, a Super Undead Bow, 5 stacks of arrows, 200k. (the bows are consumed)\nArcher, Tier 2. Items needed to level up: 64 enchanted bread, 1 Runnan's Bow, 5 stacks of arrows, 750k.\nMaster Archer, Tier 3. Items needed to level up: 1 Runnan's Bow, 1 Scorpion Bow, 96 enchanted bread, 10 enchanted cooked steak, 5 stacks of arrows, Elf Artifact and 1m.\nElf, Tier 4. Items needed to level up: Elf Training Bow, Elf Longbow, Elf Crossbow, 5 stacks of Elf Arrows, 2 stacks of Elvian Bolts, 64 Elf Rations.\nElf Warrior, Tier 5. Items needed to level up: None, already max level.\n\nDialogue: Apprentice Archer: Hello. You look pretty experienced... can you help me with archery? Please? If you do, I can help you in your endeavors.\nArcher: Thanks for helping me with my bow skills! Now I'm a full blast archer! But now... can you help me with honing my skill even more? I want to become a Master Archer, and if you do, I'll owe you one.\nMaster Archer: Thanks for training me with a bow! Although... I've heard people say we of the Archer Clan can become Elves. Could you help me with that?\nElf: I feel... different now. I'm more agile and my bow deals more damage. If you could get some Elf weapons, it would be highly appreciated. Thanks!\nElf Warrior: Thank you for helping me through my life. I will return the favor when you need it.\n\nStats: Apprentice Archer: 120 speed, 200 health, 50 melee attack damage. Helps you for 5 minutes, and you have to wait 2 hours before they will help you again.\nArcher: 150 speed, 400 health, 75 crit damage. Helps you for 10 minutes, and has a cooldown of 1 hour.\nMaster Archer: 600 health, 170 speed, 100 crit damage. Helps you for 20 minutes and has a cooldown of 30 minutes.\nElf: 700 health, 200 speed, 120 crit damage. Helps you for 30 minutes and has a cooldown of 15 minutes.\nElf Warrior: 1k health, 300 speed, 140crit damage. Helps you for 40 minutes and has a cooldown of 10 minutes. Perk: His bow deals 20% more damage.\nThis path requires you have dealt 20k+ damage with a bow.\n(note that all times are IRL)\n\nRight click the NPCs to make them say their dialogue, and left click them to ask for their assistance in battle and give them items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Warrior\n\n\n\nThe Warriors are the knights of the kingdom. They fight with swords, spears, and axes. They are just normal humans who fight. So, let's crack on with the tiers.\n\nFarmer's Son, Tier 1. Items needed to level up: Training Sword, Training Armor, King's Consent, 250k, and 16 enchanted bread,\nSquire, Tier 2. Items needed to level up: Steel Sword, Steel Armor, Spear, Warrior's Axe, 500k, and 32 enchanted bread.\nKnight, Tier 3. Items needed to level up: Knight's Blade, Knight Armor, Knight's Spear/Axe, 4 enchanted gold blocks, Letter, and 64 enchanted bread.\nHigh Knight, Tier 4. Items needed to level up: Champion's Armor, Champion's Blade, Fiery Axe/Whirlwind Spear, 16 enchanted gold blocks, 16 enchanted diamond blocks, 2m.\nLord, Tier 5: Max level, cannot level up.\n\nDialogue: Farmer's Son: Hello, I'm Paul's son. Paul's my dad, and he's a farmer, so I have to be a farmer. I want to become a knight, but that's impossible... or is it. You look like a person of respect, could you ask the King for permission to become a knight? I know this is sudden.\nSquire: Thank you so much. You helped me reach my dreams, I'm a squire now. My master told me to find more people to teach me fighting, because he was busy with a lot of stuff. I'm wondering if you could help me with that, and also forge me some armor and weapons. Thanks!\nKnight: I-I'm a knight now... I never thought I would be able to do this. The King said we are short on iron, so could you please get some armor and stuff for me? Also, see if my parents wrote. I'll repay you one day, I promise.\nHigh Knight: Hello friend. The King said I could be a Lord, but I need a LOT more money and gear. So could you... umm, get me some jewels and gold? Also, he said something about a Fire Axe/Whirlwind Spear. I've never heard of those, could you buy me them? If you can, I'll fight for you like I do for my king.\nLord: I owe you much for your help. Do you have any monsters you have to fight? I can help you with those.\n\nStats: Farmer's Son: 75 speed, 150 health, 50 defense. Helps you for 5 minutes, and has a cooldown of 2 hours.\nSquire: 100 speed, 250 health, 100 defense, 75 strength. Helps you for 10 minutes, and has a cooldown of 1 hour.\nKnight: 120 speed, 400 health, 150 defense, 100 strength. Helps you for 20 minutes, and has a cooldown of 30 minutes.\nHigh Knight: 130 speed, 500 health, 200 defense, 130 strength. Helps you for 30 minutes and has a cooldown of 20 minutes.\nLord: 150 speed, 600 health, 250 defense, 140 strength. Halps you for 40 minutes and has a cooldown of 10 minutes.

They throw splash potions for damage and use their dagger when in need. Brewers are a society, so they have ranks and stuff.\nWell, here's their upgrade costs, dialogue, and stats.\nApprentice Brewer, Tier 1. Items needed to level up: 16 enchanted nether wart, 10 brewing stands, 5 enchanted fermented spider eyes, 5 enchanted blaze powder, 5 red mushrooms, 20 glass bottles, 16 enchanted bread, and 250k.\nBrewer, Tier 2. Items needed to level up: 32 enchanted nether wart, 10 brewing stands, 10 enchanted fermented spider eyes, 2 enchanted blaze rods, 5 enchanted sugarcane, 50 glass bottles, Brewer's Knife, 32 enchanted bread, and 500k.\nMaster Brewer, Tier 3. Items needed to level up: 64 enchanted nether wart, 20 brewing stands, 5 enchanted fermented spider eyes, 5 enchanted sugar cane, 16 enchanted redstone, 32 enchanted glowstone, 10 enchanted rabbit's feet, 30 glass bottles, 64 enchanted bread, 1m.\nChief Brewer, Tier 4.

Items needed to level up: 32 Brewer's Books, 32 Brewer Kit, 10 Hyper Brewing Stands, 5 stacks of glass bottles, and 2m.\n\nDialogue: Apprentice Brewer: Hello, my name's Peter. I'm apprenticed to my master Koil at the Brewing Soceity. He said to find a person who can teach me since he's busy managing stuff, so I'm wondering if you could teach me.\nBrewer: Thank you for helping me become a Brewer. So... I see you are quite skilled in brewing. Could you by any chance help me be a Master at this? Thanks.\nMaster Brewer: Okay, I need your help... again. I can become a Chief Brewer, but they say I need brewer kits and books. I don't know what those are, could you get them for me?\nChief Brewer: Thanks for all your assistance. I need your help one last time. The king wants to get a personal brewer, and he said I could be his, but I need a bit more knowledge. If you can help me with this, I'll help you in fighting and healing.\nKing's Brewer: Thank you for helping me all the time. I will help you in war and peace.\n\nStats: Apprentice Brewer: 160 health, 75 defense, 75 speed, 25 melee attack damage.\nBrewer: 200 health, 100 defense, 100 speed, 50 melee attack damage.\nMaster Brewer: 300 health, 150 defense, 120 speed, 75 melee attack damage.\nChief Brewer: 350 health, 200 defense, 130 speed, 100 melee attack damage.\nKing's Brewer: 400 health, 250 defense, 140 speed, 120 melee attack damage.

He was a good king, a kindly person. The Kingdom grew wealthy and powerful, but they kept to themselves. At this age, those who lived there were just humans. It was a happy time. But then, the war-hungry Olimbar came with his undead army from the south, leaving death and destruction in his wake. Olimbar desired the Kingdom for himself, and sieged the Dragon Gate, which was the gateway to the Kingdom, for eleven days and nights. Finally, Olimbar grew tired of waiting and bombed it with explosives, breaking open the gate for he and his army to go through. The defenders of the Dragon Gate retreated, but set a guard in the valley where the intruders were travelling into the Kingdom. The Watch of the Mountains, as they were called, caused much trouble for Olimbar, stealing their weapons and killing many undead. But the Watch was not enough. The undead still approached the Kingdom. The Kingdom was alerted and prepared for a stand at the Sun Ridge, gathering a force of 1,000 ground soldiers, and 250 archers. At dawn 3 days later, the army clashed. The undead won, but the Kingdom still killed many undead, and the Kingdom retreated for a last stand at the defensible castle. A couple days later, they battled once more. The Kingdom was soon driven out of the castle and were nearly defeated, but people from the North came, helping the Kingdom and decimating most of the undead, except for Olimbar, who escaped. The people were known as Elves, and they wielded bows and were thin and agile. They settled in to the Kingdom and made a life there. But Olimbar was still out there. Fast forward a couple centuries. A society of brewers, of potionmakers had formed, and they were quite prestigeous. They helped kings in battle with healing and harming potions, and they became quite well known.\nOlimbar had died, but he had corrupted another power hungry man, who moved to the Kingdom. That man's name was Kithar. He slowly grew in power, amassing a group of other evil people. Then one day... he ursurped and beheaded the king at that time, becoming the dictator of the Kingdom. He ruled with a iron fist, enslaving many. He would kill those who spoke something bad about his rule. The elves watched at a distance, knowing they should help the oppressed people but not quite doing it. A elven boy saw what was happening and saw that the elves, knowing the plight of the people, still did not help. He trained, forging blade and bow for himself. When he came of age, he disappeared into the forest, with his gear. He snuck into the Kingdom through a aqueduct, and challenged Kithar to a duel. Kithar, thinking he would just kill the boy and get on with his day, agreed. He took the axe of Olimbar, which he had obtained through various means, and corrupted it to its very core. The day of the duel came, and they crossed blades.\n\n.\n\n\nSpoiler: The Duel\n\n\n\nFlames wrapping round and round the glowing blade. It was blazing with cold heat, of fire as much as of ice. Taking a deep breath, he drew it from it's sheath. \"Wh-Who are YOU to challenge me, peasant boy?! I am the rightful king of this land!\" shouted the man in front of him.\n\"No.\" the boy said. \"You are no rightful king. A true king wouldn't slaughter his subjects, wouldn't enslave them, wouldn't steal from them. You are a ursurper.\"\n\"HOW DARE YOU!\" shouted the evil man as he drew his own weapon, a axe glowing with darkness.\nThey rushed at each other, their weapons a nexus of energy.\n\n\"I dare.\"\nTheir weapons met with a resounding clang of elven metal against corrupted stone. Back and forth they went, blades slashing. At times it seemed Kithar was winning, at times the boy might have the advantage. Kithar brought the axe down, smashing the pavement beneath it as the boy quickly dodged. Roaring, Kithar drew his axe from the ground and brought it swinging on the boy with stroke after stroke, driving the boy back into a wall. Kithar raised his axe above his head for the deathblow. The boy waited- and parried it with a slash, quickly kicking Kithar back and slashing. The boy kicked Kithar's legs, knocking him to the ground. In a flash, the boy had his blade held close to Kithar's neck. \"You have lost, Kithar.\" said the boy. \"Not yet...\" said Kithar as a arrow from a crossbow nearby sunk into the boy's armor. The boy wasn't hurt, but he flinched. Kithar sprung up and grabbed his axe, swinging again and again. More bolts from crossbows came, but the boy deflected them perfectly into the handcuffs of the enslaved people watching. As a revolt happened from the oppressed people, Kithar swung his axe down with devastating strength, smashing the boy's sword in half. Staggering forward, Kithar slashed with his axe, missing narrowly. The boy took a neglected fishing rod nearby and wrapped the string around the axe, tearing it from Kithar's grasp and throwing it into the air, where the boy caught it and held it near Kithar's neck. \"I-I have won. Give up the kingdom.\" said the boy. \"Never.\" yelled Kithar. The axe, overcome by the pure amount of corruption inside it, exploded. When the smoke cleared, in place of Kithar were ashes, and the boy was stunned by the blast. The people had defeated Kithar's men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Forging\n\n\n\nSo Forging would kinda be a minigame. You would have to pump the bellows, smelt and hammer the metal, feed the fire, and grab materials. For Forging, you would have to get all your materials for the item you want to forge, then come prepared with some water and a lot of coal. First, you would have to heat the fire by right clicking on it with coal. Then, get a Hammer, crafted with 15 enchanted iron and 2 sticks. You then put the metal in the fire and wait. You must also click the bellows to stoke the fire. After a while, get the metal and put it into the anvil, where you open a GUI and hammer the metal into the shape you want. After you have done that, throw the newly made weapons into a cauldron of water, and you are done.\n\nYou craft Steel Armor and Weapons like vanilla weapons, but with 10 in place of 1. You use 20 Steel and one stick to craft a Steel Sword and 10 steel and one stick to craft a Steel Spear, etc."

This will give average data for your whole guild as well as individual player data. The link to the discord can be found [here]. If this isn't working the skyborn discord server has a bot that can do this too.\n\nPersonally, I have used the API to find this data. A great guide for getting started with the API can be found [here]. The data for skills is in the profile API, however for players with API disabled they can also be found under player API in the achievements section. The names of the skills are a little odd here. The data for slayer exp is found under the profile API, and can't be turned off with API settings.\n\nHow exactly is the overall leaderboard calculated?\nFirstly, the total slayer exp across all guilds. This is done by multiplying the average slayer exp for a guild by the number of players in a guild, then adding that together for all guilds.\nThen, for each guild, the guild's slayer exp is divided by the total.\nThe numbers are then multiplied by 20.\nThis gives a list where there is 20 points distributed around all the guilds, where guilds with more slayer exp get more points.\n\nThe same is then done for skill exp.\n(Note that skill exp and not skill level is used, as while 200k slayer exp is twice 100k, 30 avg skill level is much much higher than 15)\n\nThe same is then done for catacombs exp, again using exp instead of skill level.\n\nThese three numbers are then added together, and a leaderboard is created off them.\nThere is one last subtlety, there are actually 20 points allocated to slayer, 65 points are allocated to skill, and 15 to catacombs. This is because some aspects of the game were determined to be more important than others.

And as someone who isn\u2019t a mage, I see it shouldn\u2019t be nerfed necessary. \nRCM shouldn\u2019t be nerfed as it\u2019s main point is to clear multiple mobs. And it isn\u2019t as op as LCM or Bonemerang archers. \nWhat should be nerfed IMO is somewhat LCM as it is kinda op but still has its downfall as it is horrible for clearing. \nThe main way to fix it is add other classes a weapon to compete with the other mage weapons like a better berserker sword, a good archer bow, or something that healers and tanks can get to at least make hem useful again. \n\nSo, at the end, mage is seen good as there aren\u2019t any major weapons that get close to the power of some mage weapons. Instead of nerfing the class, just add weapons that can compete with these. As, it won\u2019t only affect mages, but you as you eventually play with them in ur party."

    "body": "Tank is a useless class mainly do to it not being needed. All the other classes can become tanky with the right set up which makes tank utterly useless and not needed at all.\n\nWhat I think tank should get is not a passive that gives true defense, since again it wouldn't do much, but rather a passive that buffs nearby players.\n\nThis passive would be called Inspire and it boost player's strength & crit damage by a % if they are within 12 blocks of the tank. I think this would be helpful because now tank can actually support nearby allies instead of just being an annoyance since now having a tank helps you clear rooms and kill bosses faster which is something that many players would enjoy.\n\nSo that was a quick idea, if you have feedback feel free to reply as usual."

    "body": "Skyblock is a game that is largely seperated from the rest of Hypixel. Skyblock players don't really care about other games, and other games don't really care about skyblock. This idea would aim to contain all the skyblock forumers in the skyblock forums better, which would improve the experience of both skyblock forumers and forumers in other communities. How are we going to do this? By, \n\nThe creating of a Skyblock Ideas Sub-Forum, and the removal of skyblock ideas from \"Ideas And Feedback\"\n\nTake a trip to the Ideas and Feedback forum. Almost all threads there are skyblock ideas. Those threads get buried, with not much people noticing the work (or lack of work) put into these threads. The threads that have a lot of replies and views were originally posted in the main forum.\nThis is because the people that can give feedback on these items, or the skyblock players, prefer to stay just in the skyblock forum.\n\nOn the other hand, the creative corner, which was created so artists did not need a constant stream of bumps for their threads to be relevant, has a surge of idea threads, clogging the forum and defeating the original purpose of it.\n\nSo, what we can do is create a new sub-forum, called \"Skyblock Ideas and Suggestions\" in the sb forums. Alternatively, it could be a sub forum in the Ideas and Feedback section, and the link in the sub forums titled \"Skyblock Suggestions\" can link to that sub forum, and have the title changed to \"Skyblock Ideas and Suggestions.\"\n\nThis would effectively solve both problems at once: people and devs who are looking for ideas for not skyblock can do so easily, and sb forumers and devs can view and give feedback on these ideas with easy access to them. (well, they already had, but now more people will know of it's existence). At the same time, the artists in the creative corner are free to show their work to the masses without the slew of idea threads burying their own threads."

    "body": "Skyblock is a game with thousands, even tens of thousands of hours of content. From skills to slayers, the deep caverns to dungeons, there really is so much to do, with new content constantly being pumped in with a large dedicated development team.\n\nSo why is it still in the prototype lobby?\n\nWell, I have an answer for you. It's because they still want to make content for the game.\n\nLet's take a look at every other game in PTL.\nSurvival Dash - this exists?\nZombies - followed the tried and true tactic of releasing it into the arcade and never updating it again.\nThe Bridge - released to the duels lobby with some new maps, and was never updated again.\nKOTH - got cancelled\nThe Pit - got released, and then Minikloon just abandoned it forever.\nBattle Royale - Oh boy, this. Got cancelled.\nCapture the Wool - released into the arcade and will never be updated again.\nTowerwars - either will get it's last update and be put in the arcade lobby, or will get cancelled.\nMurder Mystery - an outlier. Released and got some more love due to it's popularity, but still hasn't received a content update (e.g new map) in a long time\n\nI think we see a trend here. All games either never get updates again, or get cancelled. The games that did get released got some update with it to ensure that people wouldn't realize that hypixel basically killed all development of their game.\nYou see, skyblock is a PvE game. Once you do everything, that's it. It's crucial to make more updates, locking existing players into the endless grind and attracting new ones like flies to flypaper.\nTherefore, releasing it would basically be the death of skyblock. And we all know hypixel would not want that.\n\nThank you for coming to my incoherent TED talk."

    "title": "Double-Double math: Emerald armor and 500mil tater collection (6k already woo) (you can beat Technoblade's record in 2 months wow) (20+ positives)",
    "body": "RandomFormer said:\n\n\n\nhow much would full emerald armor weigh?\nhow rich is maddox? (theoretically)\nhow long would it take to grind 500mil potatoes without optimization\n\nClick to expand...\n\nToday's math is sponsored by @RandomFormer 's ideas. I'm only doing two because I don't want to search 100 random people's shiiyu's for their slayers, calculate how much of that was Aatrox, and then do a whole bunch more math.\n\nTeal is. . . actually not sick for once, so they'll be taking over the actual math parts.\n\nFirst, how much does full emerald armor weigh?\n\nA real-life emerald block is 4000 kg, making a regular emerald around 444 kilograms. Pretty heavy, but a lot of things are heavier.\n\nEmerald armor is 24 enchanted emerald blocks, and each enchanted emerald block is 25600 emeralds. \n\nIf each emerald is 444 kg...\n\n444 * 25600 * 24 = 272,793,600 kg. \n\nPretty simple!\n\nOnto the 500 mil potatoes. I'm assuming that this question is referencing the Great Potato War between Technoblade and Im_a_squid_kid (splatoon ftw), and also Technoblade's final potato collection figure.\n\nNormally, this would be pretty easy. You just have to divide the amount of potatoes that you get from one potato crop from 500mil, and then you multiply that by the time it takes for you to break one crop and then replant it.\n\nHowever, this question asks for 500 mil potatoes without optimization. That's a lot trickier.\n\nWhat is optimization?\n\nAccording to google, optimization is the act of making the best or most effective use of a situation or resource. Basically, anything that would increase our speed from a normal skyblock player, we can't do (e.g. getting contraband like techno/squid did, using a co-op, buying cookies, etc.). Luckily, the question doesn't ask for manual grinding, so we can use potato minions to farm while we break potatoes on our own.\n\nSetup:\nFull width potato farm\nPotato minions (t11, super compactor, flycatcher, hyper catalysts)\nHarvesting 5 Replenish 1 TK 1 Rookie hoe\nLevel 100 legendary rabbit\nLevel 100 legendary elephant (has a 25% to double already doubled/tripled crops)\nFarm crystal\nFarming level 50\nPotato talisman\n\nThe last one is unrealistic but I don't want to do exponential calculations with piecewise functions, okay?\n\nFor those of you with good eyes, you might be asking why we need both a legendary rabbit and an elephant. Short answer is,\n\nWe don't.\n\nHowever, unless you want to die of thirst, hunger, and sleep deprivation (all at the same time I suppose), you have to also drink, eat, and sleep. In that time, we will switch to our rabbit pet so the tater minions work faster.\n\n\"But Dumplingsushi, couldn't you use an alt to do that?\" No. Most players don't have alts, so having one would be an optimization.\n\n\"But Dumplingsushi, couldn't you ask people in the hub to do that?\" No. That's illegal in this case, as it involves a random person listening to them, and as most players know when advertising an auction, that's impossible.\n\n\"But Dumplingsushi, couldn't you use a friend to do that?\" No. I don't have friends. I collect souls.\n\nLet's assume that you're an average person, but are really dedicated to getting your potato collection up so you can be #1. Let's say you play a very reasonable 16 hours a day, and take care of yourself for another 8. Additionally, you have a full length potato farm perfectly set up so that when you finish the entire farm, you can restart and farm potatoes at maximum efficiency.\n\nFinally, your potato minions are set up in a way that they're all affected by the farm crystal (???), giving them an extra 10% speed buff.\n\nLet's calculate.\n\nA potato minion without buffs will normally make 540 potatoes an hour. In that time, a player can break around 120 rows of potatoes, each crop giving 3 potatoes without buffs. Each row is 160 crops long, so in an hour, you break 160 * 120 = 19200 crops. \n\nEach of those crops drops 3 potatoes on average, so with a harvesting 5 hoe, level 50 farming skill, and a level 100 legendary elephant, we respectively have a 62.5% chance to get double drops, 100% chance to get triple drops, and 25% chance to double drops.\n\n3 * 1.625 * 3 * 1.25 = 18.28125 potatoes per crop. Since we can bread 19200 crops in an hour, that means we get 18.28125 * 19200 = 351,000 potatoes per hour. Nice! The only thing left is the minions.\n\nA regular t11 potato minion will produce 540 potatoes an hour. Since we don't want the storages to fill up while we farm, we'll have to use a super compactor in the first slot, but a flycatcher in the second for that sweet extra 20% bonus speed. We'll be using hyper catalysts for fuel (infinite), as it grants a 4x speed boost. And finally, we have a 45% extra boost from the potato talisman, lvl 100 rabbit pet, and the farming crystal.\n\n540 * 4 * 1.65 = 3564 potatoes per minion. Since we suddenly have 29 minion slots (does not require gems to upgrade), we make a whopping 3564 * 29 = 103356 potatoes per hour. Some of you are probably screaming at me from behind your computers, but remember that I can't hear your screams.\n\nIf I can hear them, I'll just silence you. I got these mute stickers recently and have been dying to try them out.\n\nBut you make a good point - we won't have the rabbit pet out all the time, as we need the elephant for manual farming. When we don't have it out, our potato minions will only produce 540 * 4 * 1.35 * 29 = 84564 potatoes per hour. That's still pretty good.\n\nIn total, we grind potatoes manually for 16 hours every day while our minions run in the background, producing (351000 + 84564) * 16 = 6969024 potatoes. (YES SERIOUSLY I'M LAUGHING AS HARD AS YOU) For the other 8 hours, only our minions run with a rabbit pet, producing 103356 * 8 = 826848 potatoes. \n\nIn total, that's 826848 + 6969024 = 7795872 taters/day. (Remember kids, that's a suffix in the metric system, so you can also use kilotaters, hectotaters, decataters, decitaters, centitaters, millitaters, and the ability to annoy your physics teacher to no end)\n\nSo how long would it take to produce 500 million taters? 500,000,000 / 7795872 = 64.13 days.\n\n... you're telling me that you can overtake Technoblade's record with the right setup in 64 days?\n\ntl;dr Start farming potatoes now and you might have a nice present for your relatives on Christmas.\n\nIf you want me to do a lot more math like this, don't hesitate to post your (probably illegal) idea in the comments.\nIf you haven't already, check out my other posts - link in my signature.\nLike, follow, comment, and give soul.\u200b"

    "title": "[EFFORT POST] The Blazing Fortress Revamp Part I: Mobs 'n Netherrack (180+ Positive Reactions)",
    "body": "Introduction\u200b Hello there. Some of you probably knew that I was making this post due to a teaser I released a while ago. I realized that I bit off a bit more than I could chew when designing this update so I've decided to split it into 3 parts. This part as you probably know is about new mobs & a netherrack collection expansion. The next part will be concerning a new island and the final part will be about a new, nether slayer. So without further ado, let us begin.\n\nPeople who wanted to be notified I posted this: @Adaptiv @PigALicious\n\n\n\nNew Mobs\nI'll be starting off with the new mobs as some of them have drops that will be important a bit later on.\nAfter displaying all the mobs I will show off all the new, amazing, items.\n(I would've put these all into spoilers but the spoiler tags just wouldn't work with me)\n\nCube Rider\n\n\n\n\nName\u200bHealth\u200bDamage\u200bAbility\u200bDrops\u200bCube Rider [Level 15]\u200b800 HP (Cube)\n700 HP (Rider)\n5 Defense (Rider)\u200b200 DMG (Cube)\n300 DMG (Rider)\u200bWhile the cube is alive, the\nrider takes 95% reduced\ndamage from all sources\u200b[100%] x3 - 4 Magma Cream\n[100%] x2 - 3 Bones\n[0.5%] Magma Apple\u200b\n\nThe cube rider is in essence an archer that is mounted upon a magma cube. They can be found in the magma fields and is \nmeant to add a bit of diversity from just magma cubes while having its own little gimmick.\n\nAfter years of hard work, this lucky little wither skeleton managed to tame a magma cube \nand now they work together to take down their foes with ease.\n\nWithered Archer\n\n\n\n\nName\u200bHealth\u200bDamage\u200bAbility\u200bDrops\u200bWithered Archer\n[Level 16]\u200b200 HP\n10 Defense\u200b500 DMG\u200bShots from this\nmob ignore 50%\nof the target's armor\u200b[100%] x2 - 3 Bones\n[5%] x1 - 2 Enchanted Bone\u200b\n\nThe withered archer is a ranged unit that can be found within the fortress. It is meant to throw a wrench into a casual player's plans as now they have to worry about a ranged enemy while the only enemy they had to worry about was the wither skeleton.\n\nThis expert marksman has been training all his life to become this amazing.\nMost of his practice involves hitting weak points in the armor to improve arrow damage.\n\nWithered Alchemist\n\n\n\n\nName\u200bHealth\u200bDamage\u200bAbility\u200bDrops\u200bWithered Alchemist\n[Level 13]\u200b800 HP\u200bN/A\u200bThrows healing/absorption potions onto\nnearby allies. If none, chucks harming/wither\npotions at hostile players.\u200b[100%] x3 - 5 Bones\n[0.25%] x1 - 2 Enchanted Bottle\u200b\n\nThe withered alchemist is a support unit meant to help allies.\nIts main goal is not to kill the player but to improve the lifespan of its fellow comrades.\n\nThis guy, even with his father's disapproval, is a pacifist. He supports his teammates as a medic but only when things get extremely tough does he whip out his deadly concoctions.\n\nWithered Warlord\n\n\n\n\nName\u200bHealth\u200bDamage\u200bAbility\u200bDrops\u200bWithered Warlord\n[Level 25]\u200b2,500 HP\n50 Defense\u200b700 DMG\u200b1) Summons up level 10\nwither skeletons occasionally.\n2) His attacks ignore 10% of your armor\u200b[100%] x5 - 8 Bones\n[5%] Enchanted Bone\n[0.25%] Warlord sword\u200b\n\nThe withered warlord is a heavy duty melee unit meant to stand as a roadblock for early players so they have the choice of fight of flight though those who choose the fight are in for some great rewards.\n\nThis guy takes his fights seriously. To achieve that level of swordsmanship, he trains 20 hours a day, 7 days a week!\n\nBlaze Warrior\n\n\n\n\nName\u200bHealth\u200bDamage\u200bAbility\u200bDrops\u200bBlaze Warrior [Level 10]\u200b500\u200b7 True Damage\u200bLaunches 8 fireballs\nin quick succession\u200b[100%] x3 Blaze Powder\u200b\n\nThe Blaze Warrior is just a light challenge to add some more diversity and give more uses of true damage outside of dungeons.\n\nA new recruit that makes the bulk of the blaze army. He hopes to one day be promoted into a knight.\n\nBlaze Knight\n\n\n\n\nName\u200bHealth\u200bDamage\u200bAbility\u200bDrops\u200bBlaze Knight [Level 20]\u200b1,000 HP\n10 Defense\u200b15 True Damage\u200bLaunches 3 fireballs\nin quick succession\nfollowed by a big fireball dealing\n100 True Damage\u200b[100%] x4 Blaze Powder\n[1%] x1 Enchanted Blaze Powder\u200b\n\nThe Blaze Knight exists to add a harder version of blazes in addition to being a higher EXP source when killing blazes.\n\nThis lad is a veteran of the blaze army. He's one of the elite soldiers and sometimes works in conjunction with the wither skeletons to achieve a common goal, eradicating every enderman, endermite, and zealot in existence.\n\nBlaze Warlock (Mini-Boss)\n\n\n\n\u200b\nName\u200bHealth\u200bDamage\u200bAbility\u200bDrops\u200bBlaze Warlock [Level 35]\u200b25,000 HP\n100 Defense\u200b18 True Damage\u200b1) Launches 10 fireballs\nin quick succession\n2) Occasionally summons up Blaze Knights\n3) Players that come too close take\ndamage equal to 1.5% of their\nmax HP every second\u200b[100%] x3 - 4 Blaze Powder\n[5%] x1 Enchanted Blaze Powder\n[3%] Blaze Talisman\n[1%] Warlock Staff\u200b\n\nThe Blaze Warlock is a mini-boss that spawns every 30 minutes. However, killing a blaze warrior will reduce the respawn time by 1 second, and killing a blaze knight will reduce the respawn time by 3 seconds. Damage above 1,000 is reduce by 95%.\n1 minute before it respawns players will receive a message saying \"You feel the air around you get hotter...\"\n\nThe Blaze Warlocks are some of the high ranks of the blaze army. They're in charge of managing the knights and the warriors and occasionally they give strategical advice to the king.\n\n\n\nNew Mob Drops\n\n\nSpoiler: Magma Apple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe favorite fruit of a certain pet (that I bet you already guessed). If you try to give it to any pet other than this pet you will receive the following error message: \"You try to give the Magma Apple to your pet. But it refused.\"\n\nAn apple that at first looks normal but at a touch feels incredibly hot. Handle with caution.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Enchanted Bottle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bottle does exactly what it says it would however you still you need fill it with water (making it an enchanted water bottle) before you start brewing. Any potion brewed with it will have the prefix \"Enchanted\".\nFor example, if I were to brew a regeneration II potion with this, it would be called an Enchanted Regeneration II Potion\n\nA bottle with mystical properties that allows potions to be more effective. How it's made? Only the alchemist knows...\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Warlord's Sword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the three new summoning* weapons that allows for a more \"necromantic\" play style.\nThe summoned wither skeletons are tankier than their blaze counterparts.\n\nA sword that is able to channel the ancient language of the wither skeletons allowing you the summon them to your battles.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Warlock Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second of the new summoning* weapons which is the counterpart of the warlord's sword.\nThe summoned blazes are more fragile, but hit harder, than their wither skeleton counterparts.\n\nA staff that was forged many years ago when the blaze nation first rose up. \nIt is said that each Blaze Warlock passes their staff down to their successor.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Blaze Talisman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA simple talisman that decreases blaze damage. Nothing else to say.\n\nThis little talisman uses the blaze's tricks against them causing you to take less damage from them!\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Fusion Blade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final new summoning* weapon. As suggested, this weapon is crafted by \"fusing\" the Warlock Staff and the Warlord Sword\n]\n\n\nSpoiler: Fusion Blade Recipe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequires:\nx2 enchanted redstone block\nx256 enchanted coal\nx64 enchanted nether brick (see below)\nx1 Warlock Staff\nx1 Warlord Sword\n\nUnlocked By Default\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*I forgot to add text stating the max number of summoned mobs so I'll state it here.\nAt most you can have 3 blazes and 3 wither skeletons if you use the weapons separately.\nWhen you use the fusion blade you can have a max of 5 of each.\n\nIf you think this will kill the reaper scythe don't worry, theres something later in this thread that buffs it.\n\nChanges To The Magma Boss\n\nThe magma boss right now is just... not good. It works on a weight system much like dragons but it spawns on its own making it so only the players that do the most damage, aka the rich players, get all the good drops. I think an approach similar to the zealots from the end should fix this.\n\nChanges:\n- Magma cube spawn rate increased by 250%\n- Killing a magma cube has a 1 in 400 chance of spawning a cube stack (more on that soon)\n- There is now a pit of lava on the mountain that is a \"shrine\"\n\n\nCube Stack\n\n\n\n\u200b\nName\u200bHealth\u200bDamage\u200bAbility\u200bDrops\u200bCube Stack\n[Level 50]\u200b7,000 HP (Bottom)\n3,500 HP (Middle)\n1,000 HP (Top)\u200b600 DMG (Bottom)\n900 DMG (Middle)\n15 True DMG (Top)\u200b1) Cubes that are stacked take no damage\n2) The bottom cube melees\n3) The Middle cube spits out big fireballs sometimes\n4) The top cube shoots out small fireballs rapidly\n5) For every cube dead, the others gain +50% attack speed\u200b[100%] Nether Star\u200b\n\nCube stacks have a 1 in 400 chance to spawn after killing a normal magma cube. Killing the top cube will drop a nether star.\nUnlike zealots you cannot 1 shot these guys. They have a lot of health, but it's broken into 3 mobs to make it a bit more fair\n(The nether star will have 5 seconds drop priority for the person who spawned the sub stack)\n\n\n\nSpoiler: The Nether Star\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is now a lava pit shrine on top of the mountain. You can throw in your nether stars to summon the magma boss.\nUnlike in the end, here you only need 6 stars.\n(Don't worry, just like with summoning eyes, you can get your stars back through a given item. I didn't make an item for this because I was lazy, sorry lol)\n\nWith this system the weight system finally would be fixed and not totally in favor of late game players.\n\nOh, 1 last thing. The magma boss has new, rare drop that is used to craft a reforge stone.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: New Item\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is used to craft pure lava, a new reforge stone (with other uses)\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Pure Lava\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is used to apply the \"Infernal\" Reforge to the reaper scythe (I told you I was going to give a buff to the reaper scythe)\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Infernal Reaper Scythe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Pure Lava Recipe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetherrack Collection Expansion\n\nNetherrack has been tossed aside and ignored for quite a while. So now it's time for it to get some more items in its collection.\n\nBefore people say that netherrack shouldn't have its own minion, I think it should. Some of the items I've created are incredibly grindy and may require minions to help you get there. Additionally, when maxed these minions will be faster than snow but it will be much more expensive than snow.\n\nThe following will be the netherrack collection but redone to fit new requirements.\n\nNetherrack I - 500 Netherrack\nUnlocks the netherrack minion.\n\nBase recipe is the same as all other minions, x1 wooden pickaxe and 80 netherrack.\nFor this I have no image and instead will be using a chart\u200b\nTier\u200bTime Between Actions\u200bCost To Upgrade\u200b1\u200b16s\u200b256 Netherrack\u200b2\u200b16s\u200b512 Netherrack\u200b3\u200b14.5s\u200b8 Enchanted Netherrack\u200b4\u200b14.5s\u200b16 Enchanted Netherack\u200b5\u200b13.5s\u200b32 Enchanted Netherrack\u200b6\u200b13.5s\u200b64 Enchanted Netherrack\u200b7\u200b9.5s\u200b128 Enchanted Netherrack\u200b8\u200b9.5s\u200b256 Enchanted Netherrack\u200b9\u200b7s\u200b512 Enchanted Netherrack\u200b10\u200b7s\u200b8 Enchanted Brick\u200b11\u200b5s\u200bN/A\u200b\n\nNetherrack II - 2,500 Netherrack\nUnlocks enchanted netherrack\nEnchanted Netherrack Requires More Non-Enchanted Items Than Other Enchanted Items Due To How Easy Netherrack Is To Obtain\n\n\nSpoiler: Enchanted Netherrack Recipe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequires:\n- 160 Netherrack\n\n\n\nNetherrack III - 5,000 Netherrack\nUnlocks Nether Talisman\nUnlocks Spark Sword\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Nether Talisman Recipe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequires:\n- x32 Enchanted Netherrack\n- x1 Enchanted Coal Block\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Nether Talisman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA talisman forged from materials in the nether.

It is Chhristmas, I have already wished staff and others a merry christmas, and I will continue to do so until halloween come December 5th!\n\nProblems I see on skyblock is that there isn't enough christmas vibes along the server and skyblock specifically, all other games can suck it, skyblock is the best, all other games are inferior, we got that down, good?\n\nSuggetions I have are make everyones island the wreath skywars map, just in front of whatever they already have built, if it goes through chests, it goes through chests, not my problem. Not my fault you have not embraced and prepared for the sheer power of christmas.\n\nMy second suggestion is during the time of christmas, jerrys island falls out of the sky and links towards the main hub, this causes winter sea creatures to get invested in the hubs water, this will last until december 5th. When the mayor of skyblock finally decides to hire a exterminator, to catch and release all the winter sea creatures back to the main jerry island they belong. But a flaw with this is skyblock doesnt have much exterminators, which means this one did a peticulary bad job and now sea creatures are gone from the hub.\n\nMy third suggestion, is naming everyone ChristmasBoy or ChristmasGirl and then #, I propose to be christmasboy1 because I came up with this amazing idea, and I also propose my own special Jingle Rank. Just to let everyone know not to F*ck with the merry master.\n\nMy fourth suggestion, change the hub to the jerry hub, and keep it that way, forever, f*ck halloween f*ck spring f*ck easter f*ck thanksgiving f*ck halloween, there is only room for christmas.\n\nThis has concluded my top 4 suggestions to make Hypixel way more merry. Can not wait to get all of these added and get a new idea called the creative jingle mind.\n\n\nMerry Christmas \n\nTo all Hypixel players and staff!\u200b"

    "body": "The Werewolf Armor set ability is absolutely BROKEN with the right build and enough ferocity. By stacking ferocity procs, you can dish out MAD damage, incredible healing, and a metric ton of defence. Here's the setup we're gonna be using:\n\n\nSpoiler: The setup\n\n\n\nDungeonized Werewolf Armor (any reforge, Renowned for extra procs and damge, Perfect for extra healing and defense)\nRecombobulated Dirty Livid Dagger (enchanted with Ferocity 5)\nLevel 100 Tiger Pet (Any pet item will do, but Minos Relic is the best if you really care about that extra +6 ferocity)\n\n\n\nAlright, so let's calculate the ferocity we get:\n\n\nSpoiler: The ferocity\n\n\n\nDungeonized Werewolf Armor has 40 ferocity outside of dungeons, and when five starred gives 60 ferocity inside dungeons. Ferocity, attack speed, and crit chance aren't affected by catacomb levels, but they are affected by starring. (+60 ferocity)\nDirty Livid Dagger (+30 ferocity)\nTiger pet (+10 ferocity) (+100% ferocity)\nIn total we get (60+30+10)(2) ferocity, or 200 ferocity in total. If you use Renowned, you would have 208. If you used a Minos Relic, you would have 206. If you used both, you would have 214.24.\n\n\n\nLet's look at Werewolf Armor's set bonus again:\n\n\nSpoiler: The bonus\n\n\n\nUpon activating Ferocity heal players within 25 blocks for 10% of your Defense and gain 50 Defense for 5s (stacking).\n\n\n\nNow, let's do some math:\n\n\nSpoiler: The math\n\n\n\nAssuming no Minos Relic or Renowned, you would proc ferocity twice per hit. Because Livid Dagger maxes out your attack speed, you would be able to hit 4 times per second. This means you could proc ferocity 8 times per second. This would heal for 80% of your defense and give you 400 defense. Because the defense lasts for 5 seconds and stacks, you could get up to a max of 2000 defense from the ability alone.\n\nFully HPBed Werewolf Armor has 840 defense. If you have catacombs 25 (I'm not sure when dungeonized werewolf armor unlocks, so don't @ me) and your armor is 5 starred, you would get triple stats in catacombs, or 2520 defense. If you had mining 25 and all the fairy souls, you would get an additional 83 defense. A dungeon 4 potion would grant another 10 defense. Therefore, at the start of dungeons alone, you could get 2613 defense, and up to 4613 defense from the set ability. I'm still not sure how dungeon blessings work, but if you got enough blessings for +50% defense, you would have 3919 defense, and 5919 from the Werewolf Armor ability. This means you would heal 591.9 health per ferocity proc. Since you could proc it 8 times per second, you would heal 4735.2 health per second, and 9470.4 health with a mender fedora.\n\nWith the Perfect reforge, you would get 1140 defense from your armor and 3420 in dungeons, for a max of 7269.5 by the end of the run. You would be healing 726.95 hp per proc, 5815.6 per second, and 11631.2 with a fedora while still dishing out mad damage.\n\n\n\nTL;DR;\n\n\nSpoiler: TL;DR;\n\n\n\nRead the whole thing, you lazy slob. I spend 45 minutes typing this up, in which I could have been doing any number of productive things, such as finishing my spanish classwork, grinding dungeons runs, or washing the pile of dirty dishes in the sink, so the least you could do to show your appreciation would be to read the whole damn thing. If you already read it and merely clicked this to see what the TL;DR was, I forgive you."

    "body": "I have noticed the dungeons community's frustration with bad party members, and I want to share my tips with you about how to get good dungeons teammates.\n\n1. Make sure to have a good note.\nSome people will set their note to something like \"S run\". This is not okay, as it doesn't convey that you want good teammates. Make sure to set your note to \"join if ur good\", as bad skyblock players might get confused and think that you want them in your party.\n\n2. Make sure to always queue floor 6.\nIf you want to do a floor 2 per say, the kind of people who would join are the ones that are only good enough for floor 2. Make sure to get players that would do floor 6 so you know they are good enough for your floor 2.\n\n3. Make sure to tell them to get secrets.\nSome dungeons players don't understand that they should be getting secrets. Make sure to constantly spam the chat with \"GET SECRETS YOU DUMB NONS\", so they know what to do!\n\n4. make sure to set a reasonable catacombs level requirement.\nTo assess the requirement you should look at about what is considered top 10 and set the requirement to that always. You don't want any non- cata 33 players in your party, right?\n\n5. Kick bad players.\nMake sure to always immediately kick players if they prove to be bad. Some red flags include:\n\nsaying SA or FA in chat. Do you really want someone in your party that can't solo any miniboss?\n\nnot readying up in 3 seconds of the dungeon starting. It will seriously hurt your profits to have a really bad member that will make you spend 15 extra seconds waiting.\n\nSaying \"7/8 on me\"\nThis is really obvious lmao you really can't find all the secrets? yeah you're getting party kicked\n\n\nI really hope this helped you all, and have good luck getting good dungeon parties!"

He also might get better at dungeons and not hate it as much.\n\nWhether we like it or not, Thirty is one of the most influential, if not the most influential skyblock youtuber. This community could benefit, as more people would learn that secrets are actually a good thing to do and you shouldn't ignore them. Not only would he be showing the community how to be good, but he would also reveal some locations to the people who don't know.\n\nIf for some reason Thirty is reading this, heres a link to a resource most people use for their secrets. You can use it to find the secrets and begin to memorize them. Really helps alot. This is directed towards thirty but I also highly recommend it to anyone.\n\nok i just checked and he's already in it tf.

(What he was payed, 5000 or 1000, I do not know, both Akin and Banana say different.) Banana made 3 of the 5 videos, all of which got MUCH less views than his normal videos. After he had made 3, he said to a few of his Youtube friends that he did not know if he was going to make the other 2, and because the server had already payed him, he just planned to keep the money, and I assume not make the other videos. \n\nThis was then made into a video by Akinsoft, which received TONS of views, effectively exposing MenacingBanana. Banana made a comment on that video, basically saying he was sorry, and that he would be featured on LegoMaestro's channel (The hypixel news channel) to make his apology more wide spread. \n\nWhether or not you wish to give him a second, third, or whatever chance is not something I will tell you, so go figure out how you will deal with this by yourself. \nBut that is what happened, so yeah.

    "body": "So from watching skeeblock video I notice lot of aspects from 19th centaury post revolution america. I think this is very cool but I have several suggestion for this. We have minions (or slaves) and ways to make them work a lot faster and even cool items like the soul whip. However even with the new ideas i have 2 suggestion.\n\nFirst : Minion overseer. This minion would not do work but would keep all them damn snow minions from frolicking in the fields the second you leave. He would also stop the minions from wasting their time speaking to each other. In return for wasting a minion slot, this minion would increase minion productivity by 30 percent. Here is picture I made of it to show u what he look like.\n\n\n\n\nand the top view\n\n\n\n\nMinion is white and the brown stuff would be wood\n\nThis would stop all the minions from escaping and not doing their work. Stupid minions arent expendable but I always catch them running away at night. This suggestion I think would be very important and greatly help minion traders keep track of their stock.\n\n\nSecond Suggestion\nWe all know it is a hastle to sell your slaves minions to new owners so I suggest a minion bazaar. While this idea may have been suggested before I dont think anyone has been quite so creative as me. I think that similar to 19th centaury america this bazaar should be on a boat. This boat could have like previous of the slaves you are buying and display their speed and such. Dont want to accidentally buy a bad slave and have trouble selling him later amirite.\n\nI will take my creat mind now admin ty ty."

For example, berzerker could be a less tankier tank with much more damage, and additional lifesteal. Healer could also be a less tankier tank with healing abilities.\nSo I suggest adding more special attributes to tank. Maybe true res boost? A new tank weapon? idk\nOr maybe make tank more useful in f7, idk."

    "body": "Hello, please Free Mynetrix and Tiquann\n\nTiquann and Mynetrix are just normal Skyblock players like the rest of us. They dont deserve to be banned and wiped\n\nPlease read all of this before reacting, or commenting. If you'd like to comment please don't take it all out on me as I'm just telling my thoughts, but I will take what you have to say into consideration. It's constructive criticism at the same time.\n\nAlso, did I say we shouldve went unpunished? No, but this punishment is WAYY too harsh.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: PART - I (The Situation and Results)\n\n\n\nMyself, 2 others, Tiquann and Mynetrix were in a call using a bug (that most people in the game knew about) where Fishing Spooky Mobs were still obtainable in Dungeons. Thus we used it however, basically all the big guilds were also doing it, and was being spread. My issue is if you don't want people fishing in Dungeons why make a Rod Dungeonable, and its not our fault you can just so happen to catch Spooky Mobs at the same time. What I mean is if you make a Dungeons Itemable ROD in Skyblock, people were gonna find out about this bug anyways. Why should Mynetrix and Tiquann get wiped for something other people have already reported? It's not like we were abusing the bug behind the scenes, and other players have done worse than that with previous bugs in the past, no ban, and if you're gonna Ban and Wipe Mynetrix and Tiquann then ban everyone in the entire game who have abused bugs. That includes: Fairy Armor Dyeing, Killing people in the Colosseum making people lose MILLIONs OF COINS, and people who collect glitched items.\n\nMynetrix was one of the hardest working Minemen on Skyblock getting Catacombs 30 in 2 Months of coming to dungeons. A skill average of 45 and only getting into Dungeons when Thorn was a few weeks old. Mynetrix has mutiple WRs in Dungeons, and has more secrets in Dungeons Found than people have killed Zealots.\n\nIt's not fair for a co-op to be wiped for something this petty and dumb. Losing stuff at the snap of a finger isnt cool nor no warning telling us never to abuse the bug again EVEN THOUGH YOU NEVER FIX BUGS AND DONT BAN ANYONE. BTW They didnt FIX the BUG at least an hour-- before me getting off (they couldve now)\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: PART - II (The Admins)\n\n\n\nNow, I dont wanna point fingers, but Dctr I have a strange feeling it might be you considering people in the party said you came online 30 minutes previous to Mynetrix's wipe.. Dctr I also have a theory it might be you because you literally ghost Mynetrix WHEN HE TELLS YOU ABOUT THEM.. Mynetrix has changed; Tiquann doesnt deserve the backlash.\n\nAdmins, please just reconsider the Wipe.. It's very very saddening to see the progress they have made and for you just too take it away from something as petty as this.. Pretty low..\n\nDctr.. Mynetrix told you about the CMBT Ghasts with F11 immediately, and you literally said \"I'm tired of fixing Combat XP Methods\" and fixed it 7 months later. Wtf man? Is that justified?\n\nOh yeah hey look heres the proof for Dctr ghosting Mynetrix for helping patch bugs then here ya go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiquann is the nicest dude in the world, and is also a very very hard skill grinder and an amazing builder.. Almost having his Average 50 saga done.\n\nAnd too be honest, Admins I didn't even really see this as a gamebreaking/abusive glitch or bug, yes it's a bug, but have you done anything in the past about this stuff? Not really.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: PART - III (Few Add-ons)\n\n\n\nLast Message: We never ever advertised, encouraged or deliberately said how to replicate any of the actions we have done here. OFC were in the wrong, yes, but you have too see where this has gone too far.\n\nLast Edit: Mynetrix has done wrong in the past, but he's changed.. None of us even took the moment to realize we're abusing a bug. Besides I see people in the comments accusing him of wrong things. Why was Tiquann wiped also? This is first offense. If Refraction gets a second chance why doesnt Tiquann at least??\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Tiquann's Statement on the Situation\n\n\n\nIntroduction:\nSo just to clear up some confusion on the reasoning of the wipe and mynetrix's ban and some of the misinformation going around I'd like to say this. As his co-op member I know a lot of what he has done, and has not done in his past. Yes, he sold coins, and paid macroers to level pets, although he never macroed himself. Although he has gotten wiped for this, the admins have, and are continuing to show favoritism to YouTubers ( which is fair because they promote the server) as well as friends/co-op members of YouTubers. Some examples are of (removed for public shaming reasons). paying macroers to level pets, and (removed as well) irl trading and being on the Hypixel Player Council. With this out of the way i would like to talk about what happened.\n\n\nThe situation:\nSo there was a bug that I had found out about through my guild, Trouble Brewing, and i was dungeon fishing with many players from there, as well as from other guild which had known about it. All of the top 3 guilds had know about it at the time, and Mynetrix was not the main reason this bug spread, it was because of the top guilds. So when he logged on and saw I was streaming myself dungeon fishing, he logged on and joined me. Mynetrix, some friends and I all starting fishing. After about 5 hours after one of our server closed, Mynetrix and I started to do bridge duels. We did a couple games and then he all of a sudden left the game and started laughing. We had joked about him getting banned for dungeon fishing because we thought it wouldn't happen and knew it would be a stupid reason to get banned because it was difficult to do dungeon fishing even if you knew about it because you needed 5 people to clear a dungeon and start fishing without anyone try to actually complete the floor, anyway, thats besides the point. So he had said he had gotten banned and we all thought he was meming and his game just crashed or something. But it turned out to be true so i checked SkyBlock and our profile was gone. This was a big surprise to us because hundreds of ohter players had performed this bug already and there were no warning from admins or anything hinting that this was bannable. So after a few hours of streaming and being confused in general, we ended stream and privately talked about the situation with some close friends. They and most end game guilds all agreed that it was a stupid reasoning to get wiped and that a 30d ban would be understandable but still out of the ordinary for admins to manual ban for a bug like this. So far we have not been able to get in contact with admins or received any responses. Hopefully this can all be resolved shortly however.\n\nAdmins.. What is going on:\n\nThe last topic i would like to talk about is the communication, or lack thereof, with admins. Mynetrix had recently sent a list of about 15 bugs that are hurting the game in major way to dctr, none of which have been patched yet. We received no warning about this, instead were wiped out of no where. Hyixel has recently added a feature that warns a player of a profile boosting wipe if there is suspicious activity. This is a great feature, but seeing as that it was a manual ban by staff or most likely admins, we couldve easily gotten a warning, simply a message saying to not stream that or to stop using the bug. These are my main problems with the situation. I and many of my guild mates are trying to get in contact with admins/staff to try to resolve this issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <-- Tiquan's explaination of the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n#FreeMynetrix&Tiquann"

Sponge armour is by far the best set in the game, so there should be a minion used to obtain it. Sets like Frozen Blaze armour aren\u2019t nearly as good as Sponge Armour but they have minions.\n\n2. Sponges are REALLY cool. I mean, seriously. Where would we be without Sponges? I\u2019m willing to bet that sponges actually inspired Notch to make Minecraft.\n\n3. Sponges are useful for multiple areas of the game. Armour? You got Sponge Armour. Fishing? You got the Sponge Rod. Entertainment? Just grab some Stereo Pants.\n\n4. Everyone needs more sponges. You really can never have too many sponges. A Sponge Minion would provide an efficient way in obtaining all the sponges you could ever desire.\n\n5. Sponges already have an entire collection, enchanted and double enchanted versions, an armour set, a fishing rod, a cool pair of pants - why don\u2019t they have a minion too? There are minions that produce materials with way less uses.\n\nI sincerely hope that the admins listen to my idea and add a Sponge Minion to the game. It would benefit everyone in so many different ways and there really is no reason not to.\n\nThat\u2019s it, I\u2019ll see you guys later."

    "body": "Ok, Idk i might be wrong but i think this guy (ign: HunterPlayzYT) is profile boosting on hypixel. Here are somethings that i think might be interesting.\nIf you go on sky.lea.moe and type Hunterplayzyt (profile: peach) u can see that he have not the best skill levels. If you go down to minions you everything is fine. And then to collections, there is something interesting about it. U see that his collections (farming) is trash but the thing is u need those items to get ur minion tier level up. For example, nether warts. His netherwarts minion is maxed, but his nether warts collection is like nether warts 3. So there are no away that he could get his minion to tier 11 (this might change in the time of this post since i already tell him about this) . This is 'coincidence' is also by pumkins and alot more in farming. But there also some by mining. U can see his collection is endstone 1 but his minion is tier 8. Also by ice, his collection said he has Ice 1. but his minion is maxed. By this, he can only get those minion to max, when he BUY from bazzar with money. THERE ARE NO WAY (in my opinion) that a guy with such less collections could get that much money to get those so he might made another profile who boost his main one. You can see his second profile (pineapple) he has a level 57 horse. A maxed tier 11 wheat, ice and snow. There are no away that he get that himself on that profile, when he only have 2/4 normal diamond armour. What do you gus think? becuz for me it is really suspicious.\nBRUH, if my english is bad srry."

If you don't believe me on the last one when I got 540k instead of 810k that's fine. but please try and fix this i can only sell 1 bottle at a time now . if you can't fix that just announce it or something like that. this would work with other things I would say too. please get back to me when you can. \nhttps://medal.tv/clips/36100266/d1337VKzZIQu \nhttps://medal.tv/clips/36097550/d1337cPIRkOa \nhttps://medal.tv/clips/36097483/d13377KtZCJn \ntell me what you think as well"

I say this idea could be good, because when i store my weapons in my enderchest i sometimes get lost between backpacks, and i propose that there should be a weapon storing place like the wardrobe.\n\n2- Potion affinity talisman tweaks: Potion affinity talisman from all teirs should be able to keep your potions after death and have the potion affinity talisman break or crack after death.\n\n3-bank loan system: taking loans from the bank should be a must have in skyblock, and how it will work would be you will take a loan of money and you should repay that amount of money in 3days or less or else you will have negative currency, and to counter exploits you should lock that profile or make profile hopping from it in accessible till you pay back the money, and i suggest having a credit score system for the bank and make it work by milestones, as example you take a loan of 200k and you pay it back in the proposed time, you will gain 5 credits which would make you able to access the loan system again, and not to exploit that the milestone system comes in. where if you finished the first milestone of 200k you would need to finish the next milestone of 5mil to gain the next amount of credits. I say this update should be rolled in after the minecraft account migration to avoid most amount of exploiters as possible."

    "title": "Special mayor concept",
    "body": "So the one thing i hate about video game is limited time upgrades. Things that if you don't get them they are gone forever. A good example of this would be the community projects system which locks people out from the perks if they don't contribute during the time. To counter this i came up with a new special mayor idea. Lonely Philosopher runs for mayor every 10 in game years ( once every 50 days) Lonely Philosopher always has all his perks\n\nLonely Philosopher - The admins philanthropist\n( the npc is the same one that can be found in the ruins selling the travel scrolls)\n\nPerk one:\nRetrograde - Can contribute to past projects for double the cost. Contributions are added onto the current project\n\nPerk two:\nRitual of updates - Lonely Philosopher will start an event for the time he is mayor. If the community reaches the goal set in the event the developers will begin working on a new update ( like community projects but the goal is much bigger and more global - people can contribute without even realising it)\nexamples of possible goals:\n\n- Run x dungeons\n\n- Fish x amount of sea creatures\n\n- Collect x amount of an item\n\n- Gain x skill exp in a skill\n\nThe event awards unique and hard to get items depending on how much you contributed. The requirments scale on how hard it is to get one contribution in that category ( for example the goal would be lower for running dungeons then it would be for collecting skill exp)\npossible rewards:\n\nExtra jerry ( low amount of contributions):\nSpawns an extra jerry on your island\n\nDevelopers wand ( medium amount of contributions):\nClick on a mob to view its stats ( the wand will display things like defence ,attack, health ,speed etc)\n\nRecon essence( high amount of contributions):\nRight click to award all players in you lobby a random amount of skill exp ( this is a pit admin item reference)\n\nBook of disenchantment ( high amount of contributions):\nRight click to open up an enchantment removal gui. Upon removing an enchant add 5 anvil uses to that item. ( The book can only be used once on any item)\n\nPumpkin springlazor( Top 10 placement):\nPumpkin springlazor is my favourite victory dance. It launches a spiral projectile in front of you and launches you back. I was disappointed it wasn't added as an item in the recent Halloween updates so here's my concept of it\n\nItem ablity Pumpkin zap (10% of max mana):\nDeal 1000 true damage to all enemies in radius. Consume an extra 10% mana per second cast is hold and deal an extra 1000 + 0.1% of intel true damage per 10% mana consumed\n120 second cooldown\n( this may need a buff / nerf. There's not many ways to deal true damage in the game rn but i think the long cooldown and high mana cost make this fairly balanced especially as its an aoe. This would be good in blood room) It also has a little recoil just like the victory dance.\n\n\n\nPerk three:\nRushed development - Lonely Philosopher will double the community project daily limit (All contributions in this time will count for half so everyone can still get perks, its just that they can do it much faster. This also stops the admins from having to make 3 updates at once lol)\n\n(Lonely Philosopher runs for mayor once every 50 days so admins can decide on what they want the ritual of updates update to be)"

And instead of Jyrre potions increasing intellegence based on inventory time it\u2019s now based on tier. when you make a Jyrre potion, it\u2019s useless until you upgrade it to tier 1 for 8 enchanted snow block. Then it gives +5 intelligence for 30 seconds. It can be upgraded to tier 7, each tier costing 2x the enchanted snow blocks, has 2x the duration, and gives +5 more intelligence than the last tier.\n\nNew set idea: Festive set.\n\nGift Helmet: costs snow helmet and a gift catalyst. (Rare drop from presents)\nGives +5% chance for presents on the gift attack mini game.\n\nBlizzard chestplate: costs 512 enchanted snow and snow chestplate.\nGives a +15% chance to get power ups from magma creatures.\n\nIcy legs: costs 28 enchanted packed ice, and snow leggings. Gives -50% knockback \n\nFrozen chicken boots: after beating a new final level from the chicken guy, you can trade snow boots for these.\nThese also give a chicken double jump simulator to the double jump on mine plez, but only works on jerry island.\n\nSnow Void Talisman:\n\nThis new item has a very, very rare chance to be fished up from Jerry island, and can be crafted with enchanted snow blocks to gain snow points, each block = 1 point. Can hold up to 50k points, and each 500 points gives +1 intelligence and speed on Jerry island."

I did not \"steal\" the idea for the builders wand (especially not from the forums), nor did I claim that it is my invention. As you can see here, I first made my plugin for the builders wand before skyblock even existed:\n\n https://twitter.com/i/web/status/977644461625835520(in my video I talked about how I reverse engineered the idea from modpacks that I played like 7-8 years ago)\n\n2. I did not \"beg\" for the item. I actually was on vacation when the update dropped, and Dctr sent a DM when I was eating lol. I legit had not asked for or even mentioned the Creative Mind before this happened. I was the one reached out to first in this situation.\n\n3. I believe that the staff chose to give me the Creative Mind because my interpretation was the most compatible with what SkyBlock aimed to do with the concept, from the functionality to the description. I wasn't the only one to present the idea, but my version is undoubtedly the closest to the version in the game. If you look closely, the phrase \"extend all connected block faces\" was from mine, to be honest that right there may be the reason I was chosen over other suggestions.\n\n4. There have been concerns about unequal treatment by staff, and if you are one of those people I would suggest giving this thread a read. Teddy took care of it \n\n\n\n\n\nA Note About Me and the Creative Mind \u201cDrama\u201d\n\n\nNOTE: This is not meant to start drama at all, so please keep the replies positive/respectful. There have been wayyyy to many threads and posts about me and the Creative Mind issue over the last ~2 hours. It\u2019s weird, I never expected it to blow up this way, but whatever, here we are. With that...\n\n\n\n\nhypixel.net\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of this drama would have been avoided if the people accusing me actually watched the video I made but tHirTyViRuS bAd REEEEEEEE"

But i got confused when it comes to spending money. \n\nHere is my link for sky.lea: https://sky.lea.moe/stats/Gibek97/Orange\n\nAnd i would like to know what should i invest in, what's out of date and not usable much (like FB maybe?) and what's in overall meta. Idc what skills should i go now, i will get them while i play. What about slayers, what about dragon meta and so on. I have around 60 mil on me to spend, not accounting possibly leg. blaze and fb to sell if its not use'able. \n\nThanks in advance for any tips"

It\u2019s really not fair to them. They get in, and there\u2019s immediate server lag because of the majority of the server being nons.\n\nI did not say I was better then anyone for having a rank so stfu about that.\n\nOne more thing, why should it go out of sequential order? Mvp++s go first, then mvp+ and so on. Why should it go like that all the way until VIPs, or why shouldnt it just go with the 2 top ranks, then mvps and vip+s and since there are the most VIPs as donator ranks, they go last?

    "title": "Max Euclid's Wheat Hoe",
    "body": "Some people have already raised their eyebrows at the cost of this thing. The max potato hoe is 6.5m, while wheat, which harvests at a third of the rate, is sitting at a cool 47 million. Not coins, wheat itself. You can count the number of individuals who have farmed that much on this server on one hand. After playing the knife game ineptly three times. But the buffs mean we'll be able to make it eventually, right? Well, no.\nBecause they want to encourage us to use the sacks, personal compactors don't actually work with wheat. There is no option to compact them into hay bales, and as such making enchanted hay bales has to be done at least partially manually. This is inefficient, but when combined with the ridiculous cost of this hoe it reaches a whole new level of absurd.\nLet's say you had all the wheat needed to craft this hoe, and all you needed to do now was turn it into tightly-tied hay bales. You would need to make 36,864 enchanted hay bales. I tested how long it would take to do this. Assuming you use a personal compactor to turn the hay bales into enchanted hay bales automatically, have low lag, and don't misinput at all, it takes you around 15 seconds to craft 4 enchanted hay bales, which makes a loop where you're effectively back to square one. This is very generous, my best time in 10 attempts was about 16.5 seconds with 100 ping, but trust me, it doesn't matter.\n36,864 / 4 = 9,216 'loops' of crafting\n9,216 * 60 = 138,240 seconds\nThat's 2,304 minutes, or 38.4 hours. Almost a full work week worth of crafting this thing. Assuming you have perfect efficiency. This is insanity."

There are only around 50-60 lobbies open at a time. Now seeing as the cake sells for 100 coins, the maximum amount of money you can really get from this is about 5000-6000 coins, Which honestly, isnt really all that much. Even if your coop team of 5 people were doing it, you would have gotten a maximum of 30,000 coins. Which is like mining for an hour in the obsidian mines.\n\nAnyways im ecxited to see what events get added to the calendar for the next skyblock year!\n\n\n(edit) so you can go to your skyblock island and back to the hub and claim it again, so technically it could be infinite, but this event only lasts for like an hour so..."

Now let's look at his second page.\n\n\n\n\nOn his second page, there are 3 Mage only videos, 6 \"guides\", and 2 miscellaneous videos.\n\nBased off of the first 30 videos on his youtube channel, we can see that his content is very repetitive.\n\n4.

    "body": "I just started playing this Sunday, so I'm fairly inexperienced. Please take this post with a grain of salt.\n\nToday I finally got fully enchanted Young Dragon armor and an AOTD. I was so excited to go farm zealots and increase my income by a huge margin. All the guides I was reading were telling me that one-shotting zealots were the early game goal, and once you hit that power level you would be catapulted into the mid-game. However, even in a not very full end lobby, I farmed zealots for 45 min without getting a single eye.\nAfter a deeper dive into statistics of special zealot spawns, and other players' experiences, getting an eye after about an hour was par for the course. If you get lucky, snagging 2 or 3 eyes in that hour isn't impossible, but all the youtube guides use their highest rates rounded up as clickbait. Conversely, if you spend the same amount of time AH or Bazaar flipping, you make much more money faster and at more consistent rates than zealot farming can. Starting at 700k, making 500k Bazaar flipping took me about 30 min. And since it doesn't rely on luck, replicating that is extremely easy.\nMaking money is the most important thing to do in this game. Everything can be bought with coins. From gear and enchantments to XP boost and minions that help you complete collections, coins can be turned into any other resource. This means that the person who progresses the most the quickest is the one who makes the most money. As far as I can tell, the optimal way to play until you are very late game is to just talk to the 2 NPCs in the hub. This isn't fun anymore.\nI really wanted to experience the progression and new content this game has to offer. There are a lot of cool items and bases I was hoping to play around with on my path to having everything, but I'm beginning to think that the only toys you should play with are the AH and Bazaar. There need to be multiple better, faster, and more dynamic ways of making coins. Either that or the overall grind of the game should be reduced, along with the power level of coins. Hypixel Skyblock is a lot of fun, but when there's only one way to play, it gets frustrating and boring very fast.\n\nTL;DR\nA new player is excited to progress but realizes that AH and Bazaar flipping are the only viable strategies to progress in a timely manner."

He actually only made 3 and just took the money. He then went and bragged to a bunch of youtubers about it over a discord call. All these youtubers are fairly disgusted by him by now I think.\nWhat he did might actually be illegal irl, so you might be seeing his sub count plummet or him losing youtube rank.

In the leaked video he says his myself that he is terrible and just does not care. The only reason why he is giving back the money is because people found out. He didn\u2019t give it back for 2 months and said nothing so what makes it seem like out of nowhere after 2 months he gave it back. What is REALLY wrong is the fact that while he a stole money and was keeping a secret he was acting like he was a nice guy on his YouTube videos.

    "title": "Quick First Impressions on Jacob's Contests",
    "body": "From what I could gather, rewards seem to be sort of percentile-based, and the gap between silver and gold is huge. Not necessarily a bad thing, as long as there's adequate and reasonable means to improve. Now, bronze and silver rewards do help in building island-spanning farms to allow for continuous harvesting throughout the event. Bronze seems reasonable by hand and once you get one, the silver medal rewards can ease further construction. However, silver-to-gold seems like an unhealthy way to model progression. You have your island-spanning, you harvest without breaks, now the only change is farming level/pet/hoe. At 46 farming, 98 elephant, blessed rare, I ended about 45k below the gold threshold, and a rough guess to how to get there the quickest is 47/100/Turbo 2 (I'm assuming this is a thing). This will still take a fair amount of time, and plenty more players will have the insane boons that are the math hoes, likely pushing the threshold higher, and this can choke a lot of players out of the gold range and make it significantly harder for newer players to claim a math hoe (which I'm guessing is unauctionable). I don't have a good solution, admittedly. First, I was thinking of tiering hoes (and tweaking the stats) with medals: requiring crops+old hoe+tickets+new blueprint. At the very least, this lets the recipes make slightly more sense (requiring 40ok+ of a crop for a 500-crop recipe seems a little dumb). Maybe just introduce new hoes as stepping stones, as the previous suggestion would piss off a lot of current math hoe holders. I guess this doesn't help much if it's a percentile system like I'm guessing, but bridging the gap between tiers will at least help mentality and incentivize players to come back. Probably the better suggestion, though, would be to have an unchanging threshold at least for a gold medal/access to the math hoes. Similar to the spooky event, I guess. There is the issue of inflation, but after the hype dies down the math hoes alone will be doing that to a ridiculous degree, so I wouldn't sweat that too much. That being said, revamping and gamify-ing farming in my opinion is ultimately good for the game. I'd just like to have bases covered as far as early- and mid-game experience goes."

    "body": "You know how mages don't really have an armor that perfectly fits them (besides wise dragon)? Well this mob would be an addition to the blazing fortress (because the loot there is bad + nobody goes there) that helps that. To spawn it, there would be a necromancer npc that is inside a cave that would ask for 25 skulls, which could be found within any hub and will reset daily, changing location. If you supply him with the skulls you will spawn the charred snake (rarely) or charred shards. \n\nThe snake: It would have 4m hp and have an ability called charged char and an offbrand evoker's \"fang attack\" which can be devastating to someone without a high amount of ehp. \n\nThe armor: The snake would drop a piece of charred armor that is built specifically for mages giving them a good amount of ehp ( a little less than necro lord armr so anything unlike a mage won't use it) and intelligence ( similar to a wise drag's intel), so mages won't need to rely on just tanky armor anymore. Just like dragon frags, charred shards could make charred armor. The special ability of this armor would be called sneaky snake and it will be a \"camouflage\" that makes you invisible and allows you to do a sneak attack for %50 more dmg (including abilities). This can only be done once all mobs in a 30 block radius are dead or gone. \n\nThe charged fang: the snake could drop a weapon called the charred fang. The fang would do the same ability as the snake (charged char, but doing 10k dmg) and would cost 200 mana.\n\nThe snake staff: it could also drop a snake staff would be like an evoker's \"fang\" attack and would cost 75 mana and do 7k dmg, but good for clearing rooms. Just like all mage weapons, both of their base stats wouldn't be noteworthy."

    "title": "New Prototype Game - Hypixel Skyblock",
    "body": "Hello,\n\nFor years SkyBlock has been one of the most requested games on the Network, today we are releasing our own version of SkyBlock in the Prototype lobby!\n\n What is SkyBlock?\nSkyBlock has been around the Minecraft community for more than 7 years, longer than the Hypixel Network! Even though the game has evolved a lot through the years, the idea remains the same:\nPlayers start on a tiny island with almost nothing and quickly start unlocking and collecting resources, expand their island, combat monsters, then create farms and explore all their options.\nThere are many ways to play SkyBlock, and we have decided to create our own special way.\n\n How to play Hypixel SkyBlock?\nYou can go in the Prototype Lobby, or you can directly click on SkyBlock in the compass. There is also a SkyBlock NPC in the main lobby!\nYou can also easily join using the /play skyblock command.\nSkyBlock can be played alone or with friends in Co-op! See more co-op information below.\nYou can play SkyBlock on any Minecraft version, but we recommend using 1.8.9 as it is still the most stable version!\n\n Why Prototype?\nThe game is still in development - there are \"coming soon\" features and a lot of balancing to do - but during the last few weeks of testing we have been having a lot of fun playing. If we are having fun, then the game is ready for prototype!\n\nAs such, please make sure you report any bugs or exploits as soon as possible so we can fix them fast. The best way to do so is to use our bug report form.\n\nClick Continue Reading... to read more about SkyBlock!\n\nHypixel SkyBlock\u200bEvery single player and co-op will start on their own private world, with 2 tiny islands.\nOn the first island, you will unlock your first Collection: Oak!\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Few of our staff testing islands!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsland of skyerzz and Aerh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsland of okexox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsland of Amylea_\n(Note that every staff tester got 100% reset, those islands are now gone.)\n\n\n\n Collections\nThere are currently 55 different Collections in the game. Collections count how many of one resource you collected so far, and they reward you useful or powerful items on milestones!\nSo let's have a look at the Oak Collection (but no spoilers!).\n\nThe Oak Collection contains 9 rewards, like most Collections. Here are the rewards:\n\nOak Minion (What's a Minion?) - 50 Oak Logs Collected\nOak Leaves Trade - 100 Oak Logs Collected\nLeaflet Armor - 250 Oak Logs Collected\nSmall Enchanted Chest - 500 Oak Logs Collected\nForest Biome Stick - 1000 Oak Logs Collected\nEnchanted Oak Log - 2000 Oak Logs Collected\nMedium Enchanted Chest - 5000 Oak Logs Collected\nWood Talisman - 10000 Oak Logs Collected\nLarge Enchanted Chest - 30000 Oak Logs Collected\nOnce you collect 50 Oak Logs, you will unlock the crafting recipe of the Oak Minion.\n(All the recipes you unlock are listed in your recipe menu, we will talk about it later!)\n\n Minions\nOn your way to the second island, you will notice a portal, but also this little guy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey don't protec, they don't attac, but most importantly they work a lot!\nMeet your Cobblestone Minion! Take the Cobblestone from his storage to unlock your Cobblestone Collection.\n\n\nSpoiler: Cobblestone Collection\n\n\n\n\nCobblestone Minion - 50 Cobblestone Collected\nStone Platform - 100 Cobblestone Collected\nAuto Smelter - 250 Cobblestone Collected\nEnchanted Cobblestone - 1000 Cobblestone Collected\nCompactor - 2500 Cobblestone Collected\nSilverfish Pet Egg - 5000 Cobblestone Collected\nMiner's Outfit - 10000 Cobblestone Collected\nHaste Ring - 40000 Cobblestone Collected\nSuper Compactor 3000 - 70000 Cobblestone Collected\n\n\n\n\nThey are not very smart yet, but they are motivated! Click on him to open his menu:\n\n\n\n\n\nOur advice is that you should pay particular attention to those Minion menus, they contain their storage but also information on how to use them (can be different per Minion), how to level them up, and what kind of upgrades you can give them!\n\nMinions tend to work a bit slower, but they work all the time! If you go offline they will continue to toil along in your private world. They will start with small storage, which means it won't take long for them to be full and unable to work. As you upgrade them, their storage and efficiency will increase.\n\nThere are a lot of different Minions in the game, but at the start you will only be able to place 5 of them on your island. You can unlock more slots the more Minions you level up!\n(We recommend placing them close to each other, it won't make them work harder, but at least they will have someone to talk to.)\n\nIf you jump in the Portal behind your Cobblestone Minion, you will be teleported to the SkyBlock Hub Island.\n\nThe Public Islands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can think of this as the SkyBlock Lobby, it's a very important place!\n\nAll those islands are public islands, you will meet other players there. This is where SkyBlock on Hypixel is very unique. Once in the Village, our advice is to explore and talk to the Villagers, they give important clues and advice!\n\nSkyBlock is a Prototype game, meaning that most of the buildings are not finished, but the important ones are already functional (the Bank, Auction House, the Market, the Blacksmith...). Exploration is key!\n\nYour adventure will begin outside the Village, you need resources to work on your private island and your Collections. Most resources can be found on public islands. For example, North of the Village is the Coal Mine, where you can unlock the Coal Collection!\n\n\nSpoiler: Coal Collection\n\n\n\n\nCoal Minion - 50 Coal Collected\nEnchanted Book Recipe - Smelting Touch I - 100 Coal Collected\nBrewing Recipe - Haste - 250 Coal Collected\nEnchanted Coal - 1000 Coal Collected\nEnchanted Charcoal - 2500 Coal Collected\nDiamond Refinery - 5000 Coal Collected\nEnchanted Coal Block - 10000 Coal Collected\nEnchanted Lava Bucket - 25000 Coal Collected\nWither Skeleton Pet Egg - 50000 Coal Collected\n\n\n\nMost resources can be found on the other islands, but to get there you need to use the jump pads on the edge of the hub.\nThose require at least a few Skill Levels to use!\nTo get to The Barn (the island beyond the Farm) you need to be at least Farming Level 2!\n\nSkills\nIn short, the more crops you collect, the more Farming Experience you will get! The more you mine, the more Mining Exp you will get, same goes for all Skills in the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFarming, Foraging, Mining, Combat, Fishing, Enchanting and Alchemy are the 7 SkyBlock Skills.\n\nLeveling up your Skills unlocks Islands, but also perks and other rewards!\n\nThat's a lot of information but don't worry, the Nether Star in your hotbar contains everything, it's the SkyBlock Menu!\n\nSkyBlock Menu\nThis is how your SkyBlock Menu will look at first, you will unlock useful options during your journey.\nIf you ever get lost, open this menu! It contains a lot of useful information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Skyblock Menu\n\n\n\n\nSkyBlock Profile - All information about your character stats!\nQuest Log - Log of all of your completed and active Quests.\nRecipe Book - This is where you can find the recipes of all the items you unlocked!\nTrades - This is your personal shop, where you can unlock items to trade or buy with coins!\nCollections - Every time you unlock a Collection you will be able to see the entire list of rewards there.\nSkills - Keep track of your current Skill level and rewards.\nCalendar - There are not many Events yet, but those will all be listed here!\nEnder Chest - Your own personal Ender Chest, you can access it from anywhere and store items in it!\nHypixel Game Menu - The Hypixel Network Compass!\nPrivate Island - You can go back to your island from there anytime!\nProfile Management - Every player will have at least 2 profiles, you can create another one with friends if you want to!\n\n\n\nSpecial mention to the Profile Management icon in your SkyBlock Menu;\nAt any time you can decide to create a new profile, solo or with friends!\n\nCo-op!\nTo start a Co-op with friends, open your SkyBlock Menu, click on the Profile Management icon at the bottom and then you have 2 options:\nLeft-click to create a New Solo Profile (which will create a second profile)\nRight-click to create a Co-op with friends, which will tell you to enter the command;\n/coop <friend1> <friend2> etc\nYou can currently have up to 5 players in a Co-op, so you can invite 4 friends! But they all have to be online at the time of the creation, and all accept the invitation.\n\nOnce a profile is already created, you can add friends using the /coopadd command.\n\nOnce all players have accepted the invitation, you can start playing. Do note that once a Co-op profile is started, every player in the group are equals and can do anything in the game - there are no leaders, only friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you read everything until now, you are more than ready to start playing the game!\nWe are very passionate about SkyBlock on Hypixel and we really hope you will like playing it!\n\nEven if SkyBlock is a Prototype game, we will try very hard to never reset progress, even if players find major exploits. As such, you can enjoy SkyBlock right away without fear of having to start all over again.\n\nIf you ever find an important exploit (item duplication, issues related to coins, skill exp, enchanting exp, etc...), please contact us ASAP!\nYou can contact any staff member and they will alert us, or you can create a private conversation with me on the forums or you can use the usual forum bug report form.\n\nThat said, if we ever find out that you used an exploit without talking to us, you will be banned from SkyBlock forever! On a similar note, while we are allowing trading and giving items between profiles, if we find accounts created for the sole purpose of exploiting, we will reset and punish the accounts benefiting from it.\n\nLast but not least!\nLike previously mentioned, there are a lot of features we are still working on, but if you are curious, here are some spoilers on a few features coming in the next updates:\n\nThe Colosseum near the Village will host permanent PvP Tournaments!\nYou will be able to purchase furniture in the store located in the Village (currently the house where my NPC is standing!)\nA lot of the houses in the Village and other villages in the games will be rentable by players, co-ops, and even Guilds!\nYes, every Guild on the Hypixel Network will have their own SkyBlock, and Guild masters will be able to set permissions for each rank!\nIn the SkyBlock Menu, you can already find the Calendar, depending on the day of the SkyBlock year, moon phase or time of the day, special Events might happen!\nIn your Collections you might unlock Pets, those will spawn as Level 1 monsters that will help you many different ways.\nThere is a big Mountain in the Hub, and Ruins of an old Castle, I wonder what those will be.. And what about this Wizard Tower?\nYou might find a large portal South of the Hub, maybe Guilds will have things to do there...\nThat's enough for now! Thanks a lot for reading, we are opening the >SkyBlock forums< if you want to give us feedback, positive or negative!\nThere is still a lot of work to do, but I'm sure we are going to make a great game. \nEnjoy!"

    "title": "[50+ mods, not even joking] SkyBlock specific mods you NEED to get right NOW!",
    "body": "SkyBlockAddons: This mod is very helpful. It has so many small little neat SkyBlock features that aren't too game changing but are very helpful. Such as, dark auction timer, locking slots, fancy warp menu, better health bar, backpack display, and much more.\n\nSkyBlockExtras: This mod costs $5, the problem with it is that people keep recreating SkyBlockExtra's features with other mods. However, SBE will be more optimized and still has a few tricks up its sleeve. It has a good API viewer ingame, and almost everything in other mods. If you have the money, it's a very helpful mod. I don't have the mod so I'm not 100% sure of what's in it\n\nSkyBlockAddons Beta: Insane mod. It costs $3, however... it contains a dungeon room secret display (easier to see), better skill progress bar which looks a lot nicer and has more customizability, shows how much essence you have, fel sword kills, Personal Compactor backpack preview, rock and dolphin pet tracker, teammates get a glowing effect, expertise kills in lore, better orb, better chroma, show dungeon deaths, shows if items are recombobulated more clearly (helps prevent scamming), 3D mob slayer tracker, shows where items were obtained, class milestones, with the teammate overlay, it shows how low they are, stat boost for dungeon items, shows heads for minimap and has better turning, tells u when ur teammates are low, glowing dropped items, and more.\n\nHowever, if you would like the mod for FREE! I made a guide, basically, the developer made the mod open source and it just tells you how to turn the code into a mod: https://hypixel.net/threads/simple-...the-sba-beta-in-less-than-10-minutes.3459763/\n\nCowlection: Pretty good API stalking, really good for stalking your dungeon party. Tracks dungeon deaths, dungeon performance, let's you see item quality (a life saver), overall a pretty sick mod\n\nNotEnoughUpdates: Wow just wow, this mod blew me away. From a completely custom ah that's viewable from anywhere, to the recipe to every item in the game and extra info about it, to better GUIs, better AoTE warp, dungeon profit checker, a cool stats viewer, custom colors for high quality enchants, treecap overlay, custom trade menu, makes GUIs feel more responsive w/ custom GUI, allows you to client-side rename any item, etc.\n\nSkyBlockCatia: Ingame API stalker, item rarity, a toast when a rare item drops, better ah, and so so much more\n\nApec: Gives your game a neat new GUI. Some people hate it, some people love it.\n\nSkyPixel: Very useful mod for enchanting 50.\n\nSkyBlockPlus: A few neat features but it has a couple bannable features and is made by a hacked client dev. Use at your own risk (they made the link an adfly, sorry)\nEdit: Someone gave me the mediafire link for SBP\n\nSkyBlockHUD: Neat little HUD for Apec haters. To get this mod, you have to become a moulberry patron: patreon.com/moulberry\n\nSkyBlockImproved: A few small features, not much that other mods don't have but a fairly good stat viewer and a way to view giant's health which is cool (very hard just from looking)\n\n\nSpoiler: ChatTriggers Mods\n\n\n\nTo add chattriggers modules, download chattriggers and do /ct import [NAME]\nDungeonUtilties: Puzzle solver\n\nSoopyAddons: Allows you to spot the real livid easily.\n\nSBInvSee: Invsee for SkyBlock\n\nSkyBlockCommands: Chat macros, wooo\n\nFishingUtilities: better fishing... tracks fishing loot\n\nChatClear: Removes some stuff from chat\n\nCoinsFromGriffin: Griffin loot tracker\n\nSkyBlockStats: Better skill xp bar look\n\nExpertiseProgressTracker: Hm, what does this do. Idk why anyone would want this but whatever.\n\nDungeonDeathTracker: Obvious\n\nFishAlert: SBA plays the fish speed literally a second before the fish leaves. This mod plays it a little bit earlier to help you actually catch it\n\nSharkAlert: Self-explanatory\n\nHideOthersFishingHook: Self-explanatory\n\nDungeonMilestones: Self-****ing-explanatory\n\nCRANK: Want admin rank? Get it ez\n\nWatcherAlert: tells you when someone opens blood/completes it\n\nSkyblockiaNerds: a skyblock mod\n\nFakeRNGDrop: trolling mod\n\nBetterSBNPCs: better names\n\nBroodMotherWarn: tells u when broodmother spawns\n\nLockSlayer: prevents you from doing wrong boss\n\nLockOrb: Doesn't let you double place orbs\n\nCoinsFromGilded: tracks total gilded coins\n\nLockPet: When enabled, it will only let you click on certain pets of your choice (don't click on wrong pet)\n\nWatcherCountdown: Tells you how long until X event happens in watcher fight\n\nDoubleHubWarp: double warps you when typing /hub\n\nBazaarInfo: Gives info about bzr\n\nSlayerUtilties: slayer drop tracking\n\nDragonPercent: Dragon percentile health\n\nRaiderAxeDisplay: Displays raider axe kills\n\nSBConnect: 99.9999% bannable... It autoreconnects to SkyBlock when there's a game update/server restart. Useful for AFKing\n\nSkyblockBar: Sick health/mana bar\n\nCookTheBooks: Is your coop member not on? Do they want you to get 100m coins to pay off for that midas you bought? I've got the mod for you. This mod fakes purse balance.\n\nI'll add more CT modules, I only got a third of them but holy **** there are so many. I missed a few also, because im big smart\n\n\nI just looked through a lot of CT modules and put them all here, some might be bannable, who knows.\n\n\n\n\nI made this very quickly, and didn't do in depth research on all mods, tell me if i need to add more mods, or add more stuff to mod descriptions.\n\nI only included mods specifically for SkyBlock, no Hypixel mods, no PvP mods, just mods that are MADE FOR SkyBlock."

Gold medals were limited to 5 players, I expected it to be like a once per year kind of event, and I was skeptical about the raised farming cap because again only 5 people per event could get it. However, the actual implementation completely fixed my issues. Gold medals are now the top 5% of players, the competitions are very short and frequent meaning I won't need to build new farms for hour long events, and each event has different crops meaning that not only are you limited by the type of crop, but it splits up competition. I also like how the medal conversions work, especially since the events are so frequent. If someone doesn't have high farming and an elephant pet they can still stick with bronze and silver medals, then the biggest reward, the increased level cap, is limited to people with high farming levels who are closer to reaching farming 50 anyway. All in all, they did a good job with the balancing."

He did a bunch of complicated math **** that I studied in seventh grade and now no longer remember. His hoe is the Potato hoe.\n\n\nGauss:\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss (whose name I always read as \"cool fried rice gauze\" lol) was a mathematician who solved a bunch of arithmetic series problems at superspeed when he was seven years old so he was, like, ****ing brilliant. His hoe is the Carrot hoe.\n\n\nTuring:\n\nAlan Turing was a British scientist who cracked the Nazis' Enigma Code in WW2, preventing the threat of German U-boats. He also made significant progress on inventing the computer. His hoe is the Sugar Cane hoe.\n\n\nEuclid:\n\nYou've probably heard of Euclid, he did a bunch more math **** and he was also Greek, inventing Euclidean math and more stuff that I forget because I learned it four years ago. His hoe is the Wheat hoe.\n\n\n\nPossible Connections I've Found: \n\nNone right now, except that if I remember correctly, @Technoblade jokingly referenced Pythagorean math in The Great Potato War. \n\nComment if you have any!"

I know you guys are better then that.\n\nWe've had YTers here who have hacked on the server, attacked their fans verbally, smack talk the server constantly and spread bad word of mouth, abuse their powers in build battle by choosing inappropriate themes, and we've even had predators, but the only thing anyone seems to care about is this one guy saying an update time is happening, and then it doesn't.\n\n\nThe dude's not 100% out of the water, cause he's definitely dug holes for himself in the past, but out of all the YTers who have shown themselves to be selfish and cruel, what this guy has done comes nowhere near as close to any of the guys I mentioned above.

    "body": "Hi! So, if your going to make a tree farm on your island with the new builders wand, here are some tips.\nTIP ONE: For the best optimized layout of your farm, I'd recommend going and looking at Jules channel on youtube and looking for his video on foraging. With his layout you can actually get 1.1m foraging exp per hour.\nTIP 2: When you make your farm, build it above the main part of your island. It has to be atleast 30 blocks below height limit. The reason you do this is so that you don't have the problem with saplings not growing because they are under your island.\nTIP 3: If you do not want to follow Jules guide, place down a night saver after all the trees have grown so you don't get annoying 1 wide trees growing.\nTIP 4: Make sure you do the two extra layers of glass under each strip of glass that is inbetween the dirt rows. This prevents trees from having their leaves grow underneath your island, and also makes the tree go to a different spot which messes up the layout. This is what I messed up and I really regret it. \nTIP 5: Place down a night saver when you plant the saplings. Then place down a day saver when done planting to make the saplings grow. The reason you do this is because trees growing can mess you up a bit while placing saplings.\n(Also pls use foraging exp pots.)\nTIP 6: Use spruce saplings for your farm. These are the best because they grow very tall and wide trees. Spruce saplings can be bought at the new builder npc.\n\n\nWhat armor, pet, and axe should I use?: I'd recommend using a young dragon armor set, for maximum speed. Or use whatever set gives you the most speed if you don't use god pots. The best pet would be a legendary monkey pet, but that pet is very very expensive. The next best pet is the legendary ocelot pet. But if your going for foraging 50 you should get a legendary monkey at some point. The best axe is obviously the tree capitator. A recommendation for the tree capitator is to get the toil reforge which can be obtained from the npc by the blacksmith. (The toil reforge stone costs 1 million coins, and requires 10k to apply to your axe. The effects of the toil reforge gives you 4% more foraging exp)\n\nIf you have any more tips I should include in here please inform me. If you provide a valid tip for foraging I will put it in and put your name by the tip.\nHopefully this helps you! \nPlease bump if you want to, because I believe this could help a lot of players with their tree farms."

    "body": "I decided to post this in the Skyblock forums so the right people would see it, if anyone was wondering.\n\nSo, slayers are a bit lacking. There haven't been any updates for slayers for a while, so heres my ideas. I'll be introducing 2 new slayers, as well as a few new items for revenants and svens.\n\n\nBONUS ITEMS\n\n\nOld Reactor Core (Svens)\nThe Old Reactor Core is one of the core components for the Olderflux. It can be crafted or be obtained as a drop from fighting tier 4 svens. If obtained as a drop, the Old Reactor Core will have a 1 in 2000 drop chance, giving it a 0.05% chance to drop, but can only be dropped from t4 svens. This chance is significantly higher than the overflux capacitor drop, but you need Sven 8 to have a chance for it to drop. For those who don't want to see another sven in their life, there is another way. To craft the Old Reactor Core, you will need to surround 64 gold teeth with 512 True Essence (64 in each slot). The Old Reactor Core will be enchanted gray dye.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Old Reactor Core Recipe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot\n\n\nCaptured with Lightshot\n\n\n\n\nprnt.sc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlderflux (Svens)\nThe Olderflux is the Overflux, in the case that it has the same abilities, but just as costly and less dependent on RNG. The Olderflux will require Sven 8, acting as a last stand for anyone who doesn't want to grind Svens anymore. The Olderflux will require a manaflux power orb (row 2, column 2), 3 Weak Wolf Catalysts (row 1, column 2), 256 True Essence (64 in each corner), and 3 Old Reactor Cores in the rest of the slots. The Old Reactor Cores will be replaced with normal gray dye in the screenshots as I am not able to enchant them due to item IDs not working properly. One last thing, the olderflux will be a grayish old, signalling stress as people get older, and hair can turn gray due to stress. Proof?

    "body": "Use giant reforge on 5 star t10 u get 810 base hp in dungeons and 1k base def on average for the chestplate/leggings while in dungeons.\n5 starred, giant necromancer lord armor gives you ~1.4k base hp and ~600 defense while in dungeons.\nIf you put these approximate numbers in an effective hp calculator, t10 gives you 8910 effective hp, and necromancer lord gives you only a slight bit more, at 9100 effective hp.\nThis concludes that yes, the leggings and the chestplate are better than t10, however, the chestplate is VERY expensive, so you are better off getting literally anything else that is tanky. \nThe boots are a bit different. t10 5 star giant boots give you 860 hp and 800 defense. 5 starred Giant Necromancer Lord Boots give 1100 health and 450 defense.\nPutting these numbers in the same calculator gives 7650 for tier10 boots, and Necromancer Lord boots only give you 6050 effective hp. \nT10 is better than necromancer lord in boots, however, the best setup would be chestplate and boots as t10, and leggings as necromancer lord. The helmet can be a mender fedora for easy healing or either of the two.\nThe choice is up to you, both sets are great in their own way, and can do the job great. I use 3/4 t10 and necromancer lord helmet, which can get me up to 600k effective hp by the end of a f6, and about 1m while using the tank passive, thanks for listening."

    "title": "New dragon ideas, yes.",
    "body": "alrighty folks, its time for dragons to be profitable again! I'm proposing 3 new types of dragons today, Furious, Magical, and Ultimate\n\nAs most of you have probably figured out by now, each dragon (except for superior) is dedicated to a specific statistic. (Ex: Young is meant for speed, Wise for intelligence, Strong for strength) Given that, you can probably see where this is going.\n\nI'll start off with the Furious dragon:\nThis dragon would be very similar to the Strong dragon: Average health and defense, but raises damage by a tremendous amount. The dragon armor would give Attack Speed and Ferocity (I was thinking about +15% attack speed per piece, and +5% ferocity per piece, let me know if this is too OP or needs to be buffed) The armor would be a crimson color, somewhere between Unstable and Strong armor. Here's an example of the color scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext up will be the Magical dragon. This dragon would be extremely rare, and specialize in Magic Find.\nThis dragon would be one of the tankier dragons, with more health and defense than strong and wise dragons, but not by a lot. It would raise Magic Find by 5% a piece (again, let me know if this needs to be buffed or nerfed) The armor would be a darker blue color, again, here's an example, lol I can't draw\n\n\n\n\n\nLast but certainly not least, we have the Ultimate dragon. This dragon would be the first dragon to beat out the almighty Superior dragon in terms of statistics. In terms of statistics, this set would grant a total of (without enchants) 500 HP, 700 defense, 50 Strength, 35 Speed, 15 crit chance, 60 crit damage, and 150 Intelligence. Obviously, the main selling point of Superior armor is the full set bonus, so i propose that you would double the effects of the Superior ability, raising it to 10% extra stats in every category. I think, considering how strong this armor set is, the chance of it coming out of the egg would be less than 5%, maybe even down to 1%, but I don't know. Anyway, here's an example for color.\n\n\n\n\nhey if you're still reading this, you're pretty cool. Feel free to write any suggestions in the comments."

(Every 2.75$= 1 cookie AKA: 1mil)\n\nMoney Making Method 2.\nAnother method that uses Cookie Boosters is to buy them from the bazaar and use them. You can gain Bits from each cookie\njust from doing nothing! Every 30 minutes you gain 250 bits. One you have accumulated all of the bits that you can get\nhead over to the bits shop. There, you can find really high selling items. I can't give any specific items to purchase,\nbecause prices vary all the time, but either Minion-X Storage Expanders are the best or Kat Flowers. (Only get Kat flower\nIf it's selling for over 100k and Minion-X Storage Expander if their selling for above 280k!)\n\nMoney Making Method 3.\nOne of my personal favorite money making methods is to make and sell Hast IV potions. Haste potions are unlocked in early Coal Collection.\n-To make Haste potion get 3 water bottles and put them in brewing stand, add nether wart and after that add 1 piece of Coal\nto make the haste IV version add an Enchanted Glowstone block or preferably Enchanted redstone Lamp- (Cheaper to use redstone lamp\nand not only upgrades the lv but adds time!) Once they're all made you can sell each individual potion for either 30-60k!\n\nMoney Making Method 4.\nThe Final money making method is through White Gifts. (A stack cost 396k) Buy 2-3 stacks and find a friend to open them with,not a random,\nafter opening them you have a chance to get a snow minion. Have your TRUSTWORTHY friend give you the one they got and upgrade\nboth to Lv 11 and sell em for 1mil each!\n\n\nI'm going to start making a new ,Best Money Making Methods, forum every month so make sure to follow to stay updated!\u200b"

    "title": "The Entire Script to Technoblade's First Skyblock Video",
    "body": "I think Skyblock, at its core, is the ultimate challenge in resource management. You spawn on a tiny island in an empty universe. All you have is a tree, some supplies, and some dirt to stand on. You have to treasure every dirt block, because if one falls into the void, there's no way to replace it. And as you carefully navigate your absurd circumstance, you gain a new appreciation for the few things you have as you meticulously use them to their fullest effect. With nothing but some ice, lava, and saplings, you slowly transform this empty expanse into a world of your very own. Skyblock teaches us that, no matter how ridiculous the odds may seem, within us resides the power to overcome these challenges and achieve something beautiful---that one day, we'll look back at where we started and be amazed by how far we've come.\n\n\n\nSo Hypixel recently released their own unique take on the Skyblock genre. So basically you spawn on your own island, you cut down a tree, you bridge over to the other island, and then you log into Wynncraft.\n\n\n\nIn a nutshell, Hypixel Skyblock is exactly like regular Skyblock, the only minor difference being that, instead of carefully using your minimal items, you immediately get access to a separate multiplayer world with an infinite amount of every conceivable resource, and then you spend all your time in that world instead of the sky. But besides that, classic Skyblock.\n\n\n\nOh, cool! They transferred my stats from real life!\n\n\n\nWheat, wheat, wheat, wheat, wheat, wheat, wheat, wheat, wheeeeeeeeat, wheeeeeeeeeeeat, hey, hey! Stop taking my wheat!\n\n\n\nOh my God no, no the nons, they've taken all the wheat! We're gonna have a famine!\n\n\n\nWait, why're we all fighting over food, there's no hunger in this game. Food... food literally does not matter. What're we doing with our lives?\n\n\n\nA little, uh, pro tip here on how to be an expert at Skyblock: if you put your coins in the bank you can get 2% interest on your coins at the end of every Minecraft season, which is a very useful unit of measurement because I know exactly how long a Minecraft season is in real life.\n\n\n\nOh good, there's some more info here: a Minecraft season is 93 Minecraft days. Thank you Hypixel, very cool.\n\n\n\nWe got my boy Jacob here, he mines cobblestone for me all day, I, uh, I don't pay him, and he also has no rights.\n\n\n\n\"Uh, but Technoblade, doesn't that kinda sound like--\"\n\n\n\nShhhh... I need cobblestone.\n\n\n\nOk, look, ain't nobody care about farming, fishing, or cutting down trees, let's go get some diamonds.\n\n\n\nBum ba-dum bum, bum BUM ba-du bum, wait a minute. This is just a prison server.\n\n\n\nThe Blacksmith said he'd do me a favor and reforge one of my items for only ten coal, aaaand he put negative five intelligence on it. Thank you Hypixel, very cool.\n\n\n\nIt's alright, as someone that went to college, I know that you can't lose what you never had... but you can go into debt.\n\n\n\nAfter an arduous five minutes of mining, I finally made it here: the Deep Caverns, the final challenge in mining.\n\n\n\nThere's six floors in the Deep Caverns, each floor containing more valuable ores than the last, but each floor is, in turn, guarded by even more powerful monsters. But I mean that's just some blue zombie, I've got like full iron armor, so I don't see how I could possibly--\n\n\n\nThey can shoot laser beams out of their faaaace!\n\n\n\nThank you Hypixel.\n\n\n\nFinally, the Pigman's Den, at last I have found my people.\n\n\n\nPigmen don't attack you unless you attack them first, so we should be safe to mine restoH OH MY GOD WHY. WHY. WHAT IS-- WHAT IS THAT? WHY DOES HE HAVE FIRE MAGIC? WHY DO THE PIGMEN HAVE FIRE MAGIC??\n\n\n\n...I don't like this game.\n\n\n\nLook, if I'm gonna get immediately obliterated by magic monsters, I ain't gonna die mining redstone, I'm gonna die mining diamonds, let's go further.\n\n\n\nDon't mind meee, I am a pig like you-- nononononono, urh, nonononono, nope, mrmmm... oh God, they cASTED THE MAGIC!\n\n\n\nNononononononoNOnonono, no, oh okay, we're at- we're at the Slime Hill. We've gone past their territory, they can't-- okay well, that can attack us.\n\n\n\nBunch of idiot slimes think they can-- ok, I'm going the other way actually.\n\n\n\nWhere- where's the stairs down? Gonna, OW, just gonna, AHHHH--Nope, nope, we're gonna mind our own business and go in this direction.\n\n\n\nC'mon, where, where're the, where're the stairs down at? Where're they at?\n\n\n\nIt was at this moment that Technoblade knew... he messed up.\n\n\n\nAHHh.\n\n\n\nOup, here we go! So long losers!\n\n\n\nI know what you're thinking: diamonds, we did it, wrong. We can go further.\n\n\n\nThere's even better stuff yet, where is it? Where're they-- nope, nope. No thanks. Mrmmmm. Mrrmmm.\n\n\n\nWhere're the stairs down?\n\n\n\nThat's the stairs back up, that is the opposite of what I want, nope. Noo!\n\n\n\nWhen the game first came out, they'd make you do a walk of shame every time you died: back to the Hub Island, run past the Blacksmith, into the Coal Mines, warp to the Gold Mine, walk through the Gold Mine, get to the Deep Caverns, walk down to the Lift Operator...\n\n\n\nUgh, oh, we're finally here... son of a---\n\n\n\n...Thank you Hypixel.\n\n\n\nThat's it, I'm tired of getting obliterated by every monster in one hit, it's time for an upgrade. You don't even wanna know how many zombies died to get this armor. Not even that many, I got three of the four pieces from other people, I was unnicked, ok? I, it wasn't even because I was a YouTuber, Skyblock players are just the nicest people on the planet.\n\n\n\nAnd I got three repeat pieces anyway, so it didn't even matter, but I got to pay it forward at least.\n\n\n\nCome back, I'm trying to give you free stuff. I'm-I'm tryin-I'm-y-you only need one more! No, take-take, here you go! Merry Christmas, young man.\n\n\n\nAh, look at him. He's a beautiful boy.\n\n\n\nI, I was, uh, he- he dropped his sword!\n\n\n\ni gotchu fam\n\n\n\nI went to give him items and, and then I, and then I ended up robbing him by accident.\n\n\n\nOup, here he is. Trade. Aaaand I'm gonna die. I'm dying for my good deeds. This is what I deserve, this is what I get for being a nice person. Aaand... I live! Half a heart! The spirit of Christmas protects me.\n\n\n\nBy putting on this armor, my health and defense increase by 50%! But it's not enough. To the Blacksmith!\n\n\n\nProt IV, prot IV, prot IV, prot V... wait what?\n\n\n\nWith this much armor, I'd like to see a zombie even try to hurt me...\n\n\n\nThank you Hypixel.\n\n\n\nWell, I guess dying in two hits is better than dying in one hit-- nope, no, no.\n\n\n\nIs this it? Is this-- yes! Yes, we found it! The staircase to the bottom floor, we did it! Yes! And now the zombies are enchanted! But we can get diamond blocks, yes! OHH--\n\n\n\nAlmost went back to getting one-hit killed again, I don't like this at all.\n\n\n\nMust... take as many diamond blocks as possible before I die...\n\n\n\nI just, I just want the diamond blocks, they're everywhere! What is this?\n\n\n\nY'know, I'm tired of getting rekt by diamond zombies and skeletons, okay? But if we're gonna do it, we're gonna need the right tools for the job... do I hear level 50 enchant?\n\n\n\nI know what you're thinking, level 50 enchant? But you can only go up to 30, wrong. Welcome to Skyblock.\n\n\n\nHeh, heh, heh, heh, hehhh, that's not even that strong of a sword.\n\n\n\nAlright, we threw that sword away and got one that wasn't garbage. Let's do this.\n\n\n\nY'know, some people say, \"What is dead may never die...\" but those guys are a bunch of idiots!\n\n\n\nHa, ha haa, die, die, DIE, ah ha ha ha! You clowns still think you can face me? You guys might kill me in two hits, but I can kill you in one!\n\n\n\nFinally, after killing thousands of the diamond undead...\n\n\n\nOh my God, I actually got it!\n\n\n\n...I finally gathered all the pieces, I finally assembled the Miner Set, when we're underground, the Miner Set gives almost 3 times as much defense as diamond armor, and when it's not worn underground, it's like completely worthless, but I mean, it's Skyblock! Wha- where else are we gonna by, the sky? Didn't think so.\n\n\n\nLet's get this armor on. Hoh hoh hohh, yes, that's what I like to see. I'd like to see those diamond zombies do damage to me now-- aaand nothing has changed!\n\n\n\nThere's only one way to solve this: more level 50 enchants!\n\n\n\nGrowth, growth, growth...\n\n\n\nY'all messed up now, hoh hoh hoh, it's not enough. To the Blacksmith!\n\n\n\nYes, mhmm, gimmie dat, thaaank you...\n\n\n\nHey guys, it's me, I'm back! No hard feelings about the whole genocide earlier, right? Yeah, we're good.\n\n\n\nHey, I'm- I'm gonna go AFK here and get a glass of water, you gu- you guys don't bully me or anything though.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nI'm back, got my water. Oh, all those guys left. Oh, well.\n\n\n\nY'know, this isn't satisfying enough. We have to automate it.\n\n\n\nOne skeleton minion... two skeleton minions... three skeleton minions... four skeleton minions...\n\n\n\nGet the water all set up... and one last one here...\n\n\n\nDeploy the skeleton minions... why is there ice there, there's not suppose to be ice. No, no my plans... outta here.\n\n\n\nAaaand now I escape before any of that happens. Mhm... hah, hah, hah, hah, ha...\n\n\n\nAs days go by, I continue killing skeletons. I kill them, I wait, and then I kill them again. I don't leave my island anymore, I don't go on any adventures. I just wait, and then I kill skeletons. Is this really what I wanted to do with my life? Stare at my monitor until meaningless numbers increase? Am I enjoying this? When I first made this grinder, I thought that I was trapping the skeletons, but now I realize, I was only trapping myself.\n\n\n\nOh hey, level 50!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes this is the Ulitmate ****post, respond to scam threads, or any other annoying thing on the forums with this."

    "body": "A lot of people make posts asking if they are late-game yet when they are barely even midgame. It gets kinda annoying so I'm gonna make a thread giving the \"requirements\" of each stage of the game. Also note, early game and first five minutes of the game are crucially different. If you think anything here is wrong then lmk and if multiple ppl think so ill change it. Also I know myself, I am not that far into the game, I'm working on it.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Early game\n\n\n\nTo start, let's talk about the early game of skyblock. Early game is longer than most people think. It's not just the beginning where you have lapis armour, you could have strong dragon and still be early game. Also note, you need to be well rounded to progress, you cant be late game because you have a billion coins, you also need good skills, slayers, and pet score. To start, let's talk about skills. To be in early game, it's appropriate to have less than a 20 skill average. It's not that hard to achieve and you should definitely get it before considering yourself mid game. Next is slayers, if you have less than 555, then you can be considered early game. you only need 5000 slayers xp to get slayers level 5 respective of the mob, tara, rev, sven. Early game players look down upon slayers are an unneeded part of the game, while it is crucial. Next is pet score, in early game pets are not as big of a deal, but if you have less than 25 then your are an early game player. Second to last we have talismans. If you have less than 30 then you are an early game player. Last we have networth. I would say sub 25m networth is early game.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Mid game\n\n\n\nMoving on to the mid game stage of skyblock. I've don't most the explaining so I am gonna keep these stages short and sweet. For sa, 20-30. Slayers would be 555-666 (777 on exceptions.) For talismans, you should have at least 30 by now, 30-40 to be more precise. Pet score should be between 25-75. Networth is probably gonna be between 25m-100m.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Late game\n\n\n\nIn late game, this is where the amount of players drop a lot. These players have a sa of 30-40, 777 slayers, a pet score of 75-150, and high networths ranging from 25m-500m. These player have around 50+ talismans, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: End game\n\n\n\nEnd game players have skill averages of above 40 and 777+ slayers. The players have pet scores exceeding 150 and commonly above 200. Their networths range from 500m to anything above. These players have all talismans, excluding some of the newest ones in some cases."

    "body": "This may not be to the admins standards and more player based and guild based but please try to understand that the guild house has been useless for all of skyblock and i'm just trying to get my thoughts about what they can do for the guild house.\n\nI was thinking about the guild house being a place where guild can go to war to earn special perks by placing in a war leader board based on how many waves a guild has completed at the end of every skyblock year, thus giving them a buff but it wont be to long(this may seem a bit guild biased as some guilds are as good as others), for example placing 1st will give the whole guild 5 magic find 20 strength 15% more skill exp, etc. for the next skyblock year, and placing 2nd would give you 4 magic find 15 strength and 10% more skill exp up to 5th place, giving players a reason to play around with the guild house to help them progress faster? The first place could also have a discount on slayer prices up to 5% and only the players that participated in the wars will get said buff so people don't slack off in the guild and get a reward however if the admins feel like changing this they can. This can be an event sort of like the new years cake festival happening once every skyblock year. If everyone in one guild did waves, and the ways got really hard around wave 5, and would take like 10 minutes per run it would make since that it would be hard, or make it like spooky, and get rewards for placing.\n\nFriend from my guild: Pres69 suggested that the perks for #1 spot would add +1 max level cap on said skill up to a max of 10.\n\nIf you have any suggestions please feel free to post your ideas, and if they seem good I will add them to the list with your tag"

    "title": "[IDEA] Spells - A new use for mana!",
    "body": "SPELLS\nHello everyone! So, the mana is obviously an important part of the game as it determines can you/how much times you can execute a certain ability with a certain item. Even though that is pretty useful, I always thought that there should be more reasons to have high mana.\n\nI think it would be nice if they added a new sort of NPC that could be some kind of witch/wizard that can introduce you to the spells (or they can just use the existing wizard in the tower, but maybe they already have ideas for him). The spells would require the certain amount of mana and you could use them by right/left clicking them. I imagined them being as some sort of stained glass differently colored. They would obviously have a cooldown so you can't spam them. I think this would make combat much more interesting and diverse.\n\nI'm aware about the abilities, but I think this would be better for these reasons:\n\nYou could cycle through spells rather than having a ton of swords in your inventory.\nThere would be more spells and they would be easier to add because developers wouldn't need to make a whole new sword just for the ability.\nIt would represent mana as a better and more useful thing to new players.\nIt would make combat more ranged and interesting with different effects and new strategies.\nYou could level up the spells and make them better!\nIt would be more content for anyone to explore and have fun with.\nIt would open up more possibilities for the game's content, you can get a good example for that from my new boss/new armor/new pet section. \nEven if the spells would be a bad fit for the game, at least I made some new ideas that developers could use as inspiration for new abilities! \n\nI arranged all the spells according to their use by changing the text color, there is boost/effect spells, damage spells and healing spells!\n\nAlso, if a spell can give a critical hit, I'll put (C) near the name of the ability.\n\nLIST OF THE CURRENT SPELL IDEAS:\nMana cost, duration, cooldown and damage of these spells in no way are final, please reply if you think some of these spells are unbalanced or obtained the wrong way. Thank you!\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Inferno\n\n\n\nInferno - It would shoot out fire particles that would catch monsters on fire. Fire damage does not stack (you can't shoot a mob multiple times with this spell so fire deals him more damage). This spell would have the same chances for obtaining as the scroll to the magma boss arena. You can level it up by obtaining it more times.\n\nI \nMana Cost: 170\nDuration: 15s\nCooldown: 12s\nDamage: STR x 12/s\nWay to obtain: Magma Boss\n\nII\nMana Cost: 165\nDuration: 20s\nCooldown: 10s\nDamage: STR x 16/s\nWay to obtain: Magma Boss\n\nIII\nMana Cost: 150\nDuration: Infinity\nCooldown: 8s\nDamage: STR x 20/s\nWay to obtain: Magma Boss\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Tornado\n\n\n\nTornado (C) - It would knock all the monsters around you away and give you a chance for escape.\n\nI\nMana Cost: 30\nRadius: 2 \nCooldown: 20s\nKnockback: 6 blocks\nWay to obtain: Spellcasting LVL 2\n\nII\nMana Cost: 30\nRadius: 3 \nCooldown: 20s\nKnockback: 10 blocks\nDamage: STR x 8\nWay to obtain: Spellcasting LVL 8\n\nIII\nMana Cost: 30\nRadius: 4 \nCooldown: 20s\nDamage: STR x 15\nKnockback: 10 blocks\nWay to obtain: Spellcasting LVL 14\nNote: Can be used instead of Superboom TNT to open hidden areas!\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Slowness\n\n\n\nSlowness - It would shoot out slime particles and slow down the enemy it hit.\n\nI\nMana Cost: 75\nDuration: 12s\nCooldown: 10s\nSlowness: -50%\nWay to obtain: Tarantula Slayer LVL 1\n\nII\nMana Cost: 75\nDuration: 16s \nCooldown: 10s\nSlowness: -70%\nWay to obtain: Tarantula Slayer LVL 3\n\nIII\nMana Cost: 75 \nDuration: 20s\nCooldown: 10s\nSlowness: -90%\nWay to obtain: Tarantula Slayer LVL 6\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Healing Beam\n\n\n\nHealing Beam - It would shoot out heart particles for 5 seconds and heal the players that it touches.

It would double all the full set dragon abilities, e.g. when you're wearing young armor and use this ability you would get +140 speed when you are above 50% health. If you're wearing superior, all your stats would be boosted for 10% etc.\n\nI\nMana Cost: 300\nDuration: 30s\nCooldown: 60s\nWay to obtain: Drop from dragons (rare as the travel scroll to dragon's nest)\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: The Mighty Beam\n\n\n\nThe Mighty Beam (C) - It would shoot out a laser that deals tons of damage, it uses your whole mana.

You would start with 1, at Spellcasting LVL 10 you would unlock the maximum of 2 spells and at LVL 20 the maximum of 3 spells.\n\nYou could cycle through spells by right-clicking, shoot out the spells by left-clicking and choose the spells you would cycle through by right-clicking a wand when you opened up your inventory or by entering that menu through the SkyBlock menu.\n\nNOTE: The wands would change into stained glass and change their name into the name of spell when you load a spell into them. Also, you wouldn't be able to change spell until 5s after combat (no changing them while in combat).\n\nYou would level-up spellcasting by spending mana on spells, the intelligence you spend with the spells is divided by 2 and then converted to Spellcasting experience. You would get your first spell and wand when you talk with the wizard in the tower or with a different new NPC (he would give you enough Spellcasting experience to get to LVL 1).\n\nAnother thing that you would get from spellcasting is a damage boost to mobs when using spells, 4% per level (200% maximum). Also, this would change the combat skill level-up to dealing more damage to mobs with bows and swords rather than any source of damage.\n\nWands would be obtainable by crafting them like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired Items:\nStick x2\nGlowstone x1\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Spellcasting Level-Up Rewards\n\n\n\nI - Light Beam\nII - Tornado I\nIII - Lightning I\nIV - Telekinesis I\nV - Rage I\nVI - Waterfall I\nVII - Forcefield I\nVIII - Tornado II\nIX - Whirlpool I\nX - New Wand Maximum: 2!\nXI - Healing Beam I\nXII - Team Attack\nXIII - Dummy I\nXIV - Tornado III\nXV - Rage II\nXVI - Mana Shield I\nXVII - Lightning II\nXVIII - Waterfall II\nXIX - Whirlpool II\nXX - New Wand Maximum: 3!\nXXI - Healing Beam II\nXXII - Telekinesis II\nXXIII - Dummy II\nXXIV - Forcefield II\nXXV - Rage III\nXXVI - Mana Shield II\nXXVII - Lightning III\nXXVIII - Waterfall III\nXXIX - Whirlpool III\nXXX - Rage IV\nXXXI - Healing Beam III\nXXXII - Firework I\nXXXIII - Dummy III\nXXXIV - Absorption I\nXXXV - Rage V\nXXXVI - Mana Shield III\nXXXVII - Firework II\nXXXVIII - Rest I\nXXXIX - Life Leech I\nXL - Real Steel I\nXLI - Life Leech II\nXLII - Rest II\nXLIII - Real Steel II\nXLIV - Life Leech III\nXLV - Rest III\nXLVI - Real Steel III\nXLVII - Absorption II\nXLVIII - Telekinesis III\nXLIX - Revenge\nL - The Mighty Beam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Wand Reforges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every reforge will cost 5,000 coins!\"\n\nThe rarity of wands would be legendary, so all the stat boosts in the \"Old Reforges\" are already known, but I wrote them anyways.\n\nNew Reforges\nCaring - It would give +30% more healing from spells!\nBrilliant - Increases your mana by +5%!\nChaotic - Spells deal 6% more damage!\nBurning - Fire dealt by spells deal +10% more damage.\nRaging - When you cast a spell, you get 25% damage boost for 5 seconds.\nMysterious - Gives 8% more duration to any boosts or effects you cast.\nRepulsive - Spells deal +200% more knockback.\nAncient - Decreases the mana cost by -10% for every spell.\nImpatient - Decreases the cooldown of spells by 8%.\n\nOld Reforges\nOdd - Gives -50 intelligence, +10% critical chance and +10% critical damage.\nRich - Gives +20 intelligence, +10% critical chance and +15% critical damage.\nDeadly - Gives +10 intelligence, +10 critical chance, +10% critical damage and +10 strength.\nFine - Gives +10 strength, +5% critical chance and +5% critical damage.\nGrand - Gives +25 strength.\nHasty - Gives +5 strength and +25% critical chance.\nNeat - Gives +10% critical chance and +15% critical damage.\nRapid - Gives +10 strength and +50% critical damage.\nUnreal - Gives +15 strength, +15 critical chance and +15 critical damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: New Boss, Armors, Talisman and Pet\n\n\n\nThe Evil Witch\n\n\n\n\nSummoning\nThe new boss would be spawned using the \"Summon\" spell you would get from the dark auction. Four people would need to use this at about the same time (1 minute span) to spawn the boss. The boss would be spawned in the north hub area known as \"High Level\". There you could find a some sort of pedestal where you could spawn this boss.\n\nStatistics\nThe evil witch would be immune to any damage that isn't coming from spells to encourage players to use spells. She would give random negative effects to players while using these spells on them (they would be changed stat-wise):\n\nDark Beam (like the Light Beam but a dark version that only this boss can use, creates a little explosion so it can damage more people at once) - Takes 2500 health from everyone it hits.\nForcefield (at 100% HP) - She would create a forcefield that would keep all the players that come in to deal damage later out.\nLife Leech - Takes 5000 health from anyone it hits. It heals her for 2000% of the damage given (100k HP).\nReal Steel (at 50% HP) - Iron Golem has infinite duration and deals 2000 damage per hit.\nRevenge (at 10% HP) - Represents the power of the revenge spell - bigger radius (creates a little explosion). It would deal 20000 damage.\nThe witch would make an attack every 5-13 seconds (not including giving effects, using Real Steel and Revenge). She would use Dark Beam 85% of the time and Life Leech 15% of the time.\n\nThe witch would give us these negative effects, the negative effect would change every 30 seconds (to all the players that hit her in the last 30 seconds and are still in the hub):\n\nSlowness\nBlindness\nWither\nNausea\nShe would have 2 million HP!\n\nDrops\nAny damage required:\nSpellcasting Experience - Chances: 100% (your damage dealt divided by 4)\nGlowstone Dust - Chances: 100% (1-15)\nEnchanted Glowstone Dust - Chances: 100% (1-2)\n\nTop 10 required:\nSpellcasting Experience - Chances: 100% (your damage dealt divided by 4)\nGlowstone Dust - Chances: 100% (5-30)\nEnchanted Glowstone Dust - Chances: 100% (2-5)\nMage Ring - Chances: 16%\nPart of the new Mage Armor - Chances: 20%\n\nTop 5 required:\nSpellcasting Experience - Chances: 100% (your damage dealt divided by 4)\nGlowstone Dust - Chances: 100% (20-45)\nEnchanted Glowstone Dust - Chances: 100% (4-10)\nMage Ring - Chances: 30%\nPart of the new Mage Armor - Chances: 40%\nPart of the new Wizard Armor - Chances: 15%\nWizard Artifact - Chances: 20%\n\nTop 1 required:\nSpellcasting Experience - Chances: 100% (your damage dealt divided by 4)\nGlowstone Dust - Chances: 100% (40-60)\nEnchanted Glowstone Dust - Chances: 100% (18-30)\nMage Ring - Chances: 95%\nPart of the new Mage Armor - Chances: 80%\nPart of the new Wizard Armor - Chances: 25%\nWizard Artifact - Chances: 30%\nLegendary Raven Pet - Chances: >0.1%\n\n\nNOTE: You can't get a piece of the mage and the wizard armor/talisman from the same boss battle loot, you also can't get a talisman and a piece of armor from the same boss battle loot.\n\nDrop Information\n\n\nSpoiler: Mage/Wizard Talismans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Mage Armor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Wizard Armor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Raven Pet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaven Pet\n\n\nRarity: LEGENDARY\nSkill: Spellcasting\nSpeed: +1 per 2 levels (MAX: 50)\nIntelligence: +2 per 1 levels (MAX: 200)\n\n1st Ability: Mystic Mana \nRegenerates mana 0.1% faster per level.

The drawing of spells that I used in this post are drawn by me using Pixiliart and they are not a subject of copyright infringement.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)\n\n\n\nQ: Wouldn't this make it more like Wynncraft?\nA: I never played Wynncraft, but from what I heard my system for spells is much different from theirs and also spells are a part of a lot of other RPG/MMORPG medieval games so I don't see a problem.\n\nQ: Why would wands be so easy to craft?\nA: The reason for wand being so easily crafted is because that I think leveling up spellcasting is a challenge already, I don't want to make it hard for players to use spells.\n\nQ: Shouldn't they first focus on adding more ways to get higher mana?\nA: There is no need for that with the low spell mana cost and the new armors I would introduce with the evil witch boss.\n\nQ: Wouldn't this change the price for a lot of items like the Wise Armor?\nA: Yes, it would.\n\nQ: Would the Magic/Ability damage effect the damage of spells?\nA: Surprisingly, I decided for it to not. I didn't include magic damage because it was broken recently (1st of June) and only way to obtain it currently is through the sheep pet and I don't want the sheep pet that is an alchemy pet to have much to do with the spells. Also, the real name of Magic Damage is Ability Damage and these are spells.\n\nQ: Would the wise dragon's armor full set bonus effect the mana cost of the spells?\nA: Yes, it would.\n\nQ: Would the defence block a percentage of damage you get by spells?\nA: Yes, it would.\n\n\n\nAlso, it would be a nice addition to my other, colosseum update idea, check it out if you want: https://hypixel.net/threads/idea-colosseum-update.3043624/\n\nPlease, tell me what you think and if you liked it, please leave a \n\n\n, I would really appreciate it! \nBefore asking a question, please check the FAQ section to see if the answer is already listed there.

    "body": "Items/new feature that would improve life on Hypixel Skyblock (I believe):\n- Village Affinity (ring/artifact): Ring- removes the personal bank cooldown while in the Village, Auction House, or Bazaar. Increases Speed by +25%, while in the Village. Village Affinity Artifact: Allows you to spend $$$ directly from your bank on the ah, while in the auction house, gives buff from village affinity ring, gives +100% speed while in the Village.\n\n- Reforge Bag: Allows you to reforge multiple items at once, costing the cumulative amount of all of the items. When using Accessories, gives the discount present in the Accessory Bag on all of the accessories in the bag. Can hold a double chest full of items, but only reforgable items can be held in it and no player may have more than 1 in his/her inventory. (Edit: maybe instead of an item this is accessible when speaking to the blacksmith, to make it simpler and easier to use)\n\n- Piggy bank patch: (costs 8 enchanted pork): when right-clicked, repair the active piggy bank in your inv by 1.\n\n- Wardrobe totem: Left-Click: switches the current set you are wearing one to the right, and does not work if you aren't wearing a set. Right-Click: opens the wardrobe menu.\n\nCleaning stone - costs $500 from the guy who sells all those reforge stones, and is free to apply. Removes all of the items enchantments and anvil uses, as well as refunds any fuming potato books used on the item (or it just deletes em but I feel like that is too expensive/mean)\n\n(not an item but) Sac of sacs settings: allow you to disable items going into your sacs, withdraw/deposit all items from and into sacs, and has a setting where all items coming from minions do not go into sacs.\n\nRemoved BIN cap - this would help a lot for things who\u2019s BIN cap is way to low, to make it so it doesn\u2019t always have to go on auction, preventing steals (when someone bids incredibly low on an item and gets it cause no one else bidded)\n\nAuction house fix - you can now look for supreme rarity items, and there\u2019s a new all category, containing all of the categories, and custom categories, which only search for specific items ( such as fishing enchantments, or talismans.)\n\nMulti-use wardrobe: one item( such as a hat) can be used for multiple wardrobe slots, meaning you don\u2019t have to switch that item between them. \n\nAuto-match - automatically matches your bazaar order to the top +1 so you don\u2019t have to cancel and shiz.\n\nPlease tell me what you think in the comments!"

Lets calculate how much money pokimane makes per stream, from her simps! \n\n\nBACKGROUND INFO\nYouTubers get paid $2 \u2013 $7 per 1000 monetized views after YouTube takes its cut. Monetized views range from 40% \u2013 80% of the total views. All these are influenced by several factors like device played on, the location of the viewer, ad inventory, how many ads there are on a video, how many people skip the ads, type of advertisement, ad engagement , type of content etc. The cost of an ad view is based on an auction between advertisers based on views. Advertisers have to bid a minimum of $0.01 per view. Officially, Twitch Partners and Affiliates receive 50% of the total subscription fee, so for the $4.99 tier, the streamer would get around $2.50. Twitch has been known to increase this amount for popular streamers to encourage them to remain on the Twitch platform, with some being upgraded to anywhere from 60% to 100% of the monthly fee. Streamers make money through the Cheering feature when a fan cheers with bits in the chat. A Cheer is an animated chat emote that uses bits. Typing \u201cCheer1\u201d will generate a grey bouncing triangle, and cost you 1.4 cents. \u201cCheer100\u201d brings up a dancing purple diamond, and costs you $1.4. You can Cheer any amount you please (including irregular figures, and the corresponding emotes get larger and larger, up to a \u201cCheer 10000,\u201d a $140 tip represented by a fractured red star. streamers will get 1 cent for every Bit pledged while Twitch will keep the 0.4 cents. Pokimane is able to make even more revenue through brand deals which pay a large amount of money for every post on social media and mentions in her content. She has worked with brands like Hot Pocket, Epic Games, Geico, AzurLane, Lineage 2 etc The channel has over 5 million subscribers as of 2020 and has accumulated over 500 million views so far. It is able to get an average of 460,000 views per day from different sources. This should result in an estimated revenue of around $2,300 per day ($840,000 a year) from the ads that appear on the videos. YouTubers get paid $2 \u2013 $7 per 1000 monetized views after YouTube takes its cut. Monetized views range from 40% \u2013 80% of the total views. All these are influenced by several factors like device played on, the location of the viewer, ad inventory, how many ads there are on a video, how many people skip the ads, type of advertisement, ad engagement , type of content etc. The cost of an ad view is based on an auction between advertisers based on views. Advertisers have to bid a minimum of $0.01 per view. There is also a program known as Google Preferred where deep-pocketed companies can target ads on the top 5% most popular content. The ad rates here are higher than normal. Apart from ads, YouTubers also generate extra from YouTube Red viewers who pay a monthly fee to view premium content on YouTube plus watch videos without ads. Here they get paid based on watch time on their videos. The longer the viewers watch their videos, the more money they earn.\n\nThe Math\nOk, so lets get to the stream info, as ^ was all background stuff. She is able to average around 10,000 viewers per stream and has had a peak of 73,000 viewers in a single stream. So, with this information at hand, and looking at how she has recently put in a 5 dollar donation cap, and around 40% of viewers watching at a single time donate, and also factoring in all the tiered subs, and knowing that she makes 20k per month, and we divide that with her stream schedule (3 days per week) so 12 streams per month, she makes around $1666 PER STREAM, which is a giant number! \n\nTLDR:\nPokimane makes around $1666 per stream\n\nSb related : midas staff or save?"

First of all i am going to talk a little bit about myself, i am a simp because i am staying true to myself, it s in every single s male instinct to provide for a female with out any reason, it s just a matter of if you are gonna act on ur calling, but for me simping for a woman is equivalent to simping for a ytber, all my simp friends think it s weird but think about it the same feeling u get when u simp for a woman u get it also when u buy a bucket of sperm from refraction s auction house, i just love it, me personally i started simping the very first day of sb s realese, i just gave away every single item i got while playing for 6h to thirtyvirus and i just couldn t get enough of that feeling, and i countinued up until this point where i am a lvl 100 simp and i started dedicating my life to bazzar flipping long ago when i started realizing that it s the best money making method in the game, and rn i make 2bil a week and i am SOO DAM good at bazzar flipping that i can convince every single person in a 5000 mile radius with the power of my mind to stop putting up orders with 10% spread I AM SOO friking good at bazzar flipping that i can literally predict how items are gonna go up in price months before updates come out.\nAnyway, here are the reasons to why you should dedicate your entiere soul to making coins as eficiently as posible and going to every single streamer ever and giving it to them:\nNumber 1: Youtubers need money for providing content so they can give back to the community guys!\nNumber 2: If you are staying true to yourself and you stop being conformed by every salty player you are going to stop enjoying giving money to youtubers guys , so start being a simp and living up to your nature s profecey!\nNumber 3: If you say that\" i shouldn t give money to this sb streamer there s always another person to give it to them\" NO NO NOO STOPP RIGH THERE guys listen here i have been stabbed in the chest multiple chests and i always been a victim to the by stander effect you can t just assume that streamrs are going to get money from other sources instead of YOU, imagine if everyone was thinking the same and furryeboy was asking for money and no one was giving it to them guys it would be akwaaaaard! you don t want that to happen!!\nNumber 4: Fame! you might say \"nO oNe FrIkInG cArEs iF yOu dOnate to yters you are not going to get famous for it\" Wrong! me personally i am pretty quirky and every single time i see someone give yters free stuff i say \"hey there u poor soul u prob thot you are going to be forgotten \" and i find out on other parts of my life that i thought i m diffrent that i m not that diffrent so this must be the case for everyone watching streamers guys!!!!\nand ur going to be in the core memory of milions!\nSo that s it guys i hope i helped life is only about living up to ur nature so life is only about simping now i go eat yter as"

Farming is quicker and better than fishing.\n\n\n2: Combat\nGives you more crit chance, and if you have a lot of crit damage, combat is op.\n\n\n1: Farming\nGives health, which is just fishing, yeah, but it's quick and easy to do when you have young dragon armor and a farm full of pumpkins.\n\n\n\n\nThank you for looking at my guide, and I'm glad I could help you on this MMO server.

So, minions are duping themselves.\n\nThis is a huge problem as duping and dupe glitches are illegal, so from now on upgrading minions is illegal, and you and the minion will get permanently banned and wiped for duping.\n\nTLDR: Minions are asexually reproducing, or duplicating themselves, so upgrading minions is illegal and will get you wiped and banned.\nthis isnt supposed to make sense please help"

I am hoping that making this discord server that it can help new and old dungeon players find the perfect party and maybe even a permeant party!\n\nWhat The Discord Server Has To Offer\nThe discord server has many different things to offer such as, information to all the new Hypixel Skyblock updates and leaks. Reaction roles to give yourself the opportunity to pick what you want to be notified on along with the ability to give yourself a dungeon class role to let everyone else know what class you are. Different discord categories with each one dedicated to a certain dungeon floor so you can find the perfect party. A leveling system in the discord (aint very unique) but also a work in progress bot with the final ability to see your catacombs level and give you a role showing you catacombs level!\n\nThis discord server is very new so please if you would allow me to help some people with the help I needed that would be great thanks!\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Discord Link\n\n\n\n[/https://discord.gg/yCBma6s5cs]"

But it would cost 1-50m depending on them item's rarity. For example if you have a Hunters Knife and a Rogue sword and you were to put the Hunters knife before the rogue sword in the special anvil it would look something like this...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make this balanced you would not be able to merge different mage abilitys such as bonzo/frozen scythe and the damage would be reduced by 10-50% depending on the rarity.This would cost 5million skyblock coins to merge. After merging there is is a nothing special anvil that you can use to set it back to normal and get the 2 items back. This would cost 1-50m depending on the item too!

Good thing we sold before they tanked...\n\nThe applications are currently open.\n\nRequirements\n- Must be active, not necessarily on skyblock, but in /gc or in the discord\n- A working discord account (you need to join our discord server)\n- No age requirement, although, most of us are between 14-18 years old\n\nSkyblock Requirements\n- You must have a 26 skill average (This is mandatory)\n- You must have EITHER 350k slayer EXP or Catacombs level 19.

I don't want pity or items, in fact ill probably not play skyblock again because of this, to be set so far back, months of progress wasted.

    "title": "[Idea] Titles",
    "body": "Hi! Just wanted to drop an idea that I had for Skyblock.\n\nLet me start this off by saying that part of this idea came from a feature in another previously popular Minecraft server, (may it rest in peace) however, I also like to do this sort of a thing for discord servers that I'm a part of to make things more enjoyable. I feel people would really like this to be implemented into Skyblock.\n\nTitles.\n\nTitles are a cosmetic hologram of sorts that would sit just above the players head. These holograms would allow players to show off their favorite achievements in the game.\n\nFor example; Say a player were to reach a certain milestone in wheat collection (say, 1 million). There could be a title for reaching this point. A good title might be something as simple as: Wheat (I, II, III, IV, etc.) or maybe something even more creative!\n\nTitles could be applied to many of the different accomplishments in Skyblock and I happen to have a fresh amount of examples and suggestions using titles that I had previously come up with.\n\nSkill-Based Titles:\nFighter (I-V)- Reach combat 5, 10, 25, 40, 50.\nProspector (I-V)- Reach mining 5, 10, 25, 40, 50.\nLaborer (I-V)- Reach Farming 5, 10, 25, 40, 50.\nLumberjack (I-V)- Reach Foraging 5, 10, 25, 40, 50.\nFisherman (I-V)- Reach Fishing 5, 10, 25, 40, 50.\nWizard (I-V)- Reach Enchanting 5, 10, 25, 40, 50.\nWitch (I-V)- Reach Alchemy 5, 10, 25, 40, 50.\nBeastmaster (I-V)- Reach Taming 5, 10, 25, 40, 50.\nJack of All Trades- Reach level 25 in all skills (Excluding Carpentry, Runecrafting, and Dungeons)\nMaster of One- Reach level 50 in any skill (Excluding C, R, D)\nMaster of All- Reach level 50 in every skill (Excluding C, R, D)\nOverachiever- Reach level 60 in any skill\nSettle Down Now- Reach level 60 in every skill (If the other skills aside from farming are increased to 60)\n\nCollection: I won't go super far into detail because there are a ton of collections but obviously adding a tier for each collection would be cool if added.\nCollector- Max out every collection (I understand collections are constantly being added to so this can be locked up whenever there is an addition untilthe player unlocks said addition)\nMaster Crafter- Unlock all recipes (Same standard as collections when it comes to additions)\n\nAnother thing that should be added to collection titles is a specific title that can be passed along to the #1 collector for each collection! A special title that would show off just how dedicated they are to their #1 spot.\n\nA few ideas for this are as follows:\n20/20 Vision- #1 Carrot collection\nPicea Bane- #1 Spruce collection\nHonest Worker- #1 Wheat collection\nKrampus- #1 Coal Collection\nMidas- #1 Gold Collection\netc...\n\nPets:\nAshborn- Obtain a Phoenix Pet by killing a mob.\nDovah- Obtain the Ender Dragon Pet by slaying the Ender Dragon.\nLost to the Void- Obtain a Legendary Enderman Pet.\nAnimal Friendly- Own a pet.\nVeterinarian- Own 5 unique pets.\nZookeeper- Own 10 unique pets.\nIrwin- Own 20 unique pets.\nExotic- Purchase a legendary pet from Oringo.\nPet Smuggler- Purchase a pet from the Dark Auction.\nTrainer- Train a pet to level 100.\nElite Four- Train 4 legendary pets to level 100.\nNoah- Obtain every legendary pet.\n\nSpecific Items:\nMy Fish- Collect 5 different special fish.\nDaenerys- Obtain all Dragon armor sets.\nSuperior- Obtain a full set of Superior Dragon armor.\nGolden Touch- Obtain a 50 million Midas Sword.\nCereal Killer- Obtain a 100 million Midas Staff.\nBling- Own a full set of Superior Dragon armor, a 50 million Midas Sword, AND a 100 million Midas Staff.\n\nDungeons:\n(Will add in the future if this idea takes off)\n\nI have a lot more in mind and would be more than willing to add more if this gets any interest. I think these titles would make an excellent addition to the game, and would allow players to really show off what they've got!\n\nFeel free to give me any feedback or suggestions!"

    "body": "Things I forgot last time: \n\nEnchanted Cooked Fish being in Bait Bag (th1s1sau)\nThe hypothetical ability for minions to store items (DumplingSushi)\nIsland Upgrades (ForumsLawyer)\nCake Bag (ForumsLawyer, IYeet_Gaming)\nGriffin Pet (DumplingSushi)\nSack Of Sacks Upgrades (Me)\nIsland Dimensions (Kasstertroy30)\n\nGiven: Island Size: 241 x 256 x 241\nGiven: 10 extra sacks\nGiven: You're allowed to store resources in minions\nGiven: You're able to uncraft items\nGiven: Only pets that you are using counts (If you have a phoenix and a zombie, and you have the phoenix out, only the phoenix counts)\nGiven: Items stored in minions have to be able to be produced by the minions.\n\nBase Item\n\nAlright, so let's say we're going to house our stuff in a Jumbo Backpack. Good. We now have 54 slots, to put other stuff. A minion has 15 slots for items, plus an additional 5 for upgrades/fuels/skins/automated shipping. Good. Now, the current most \"item-dense\" thing that can be produced by a minion is enchanted golden blocks. Each enchanted golden block would contain 160 Enchanted Gold, 25600 Regular Gold, or 230400 golden nuggets. We now multiply this number by 64. Great. We now have 14745600 materials per stack. Now, we will multiply this by 15 (maximum slots in a minion). We now have a total of 221184000 materials stored, per minion. Now, we would multiply this by 54, as that is the number of slots in a Jumbo Backpack. We now have 11943936000 items stored in one slot.\n\nInventory\n\nNow that we've figured out the number of items that we can store in one item, we would multiply 11943936000 by 35, and then add 1 for the skyblock menu. (11943936000*35)+1). Total? 418037760001.\n\nEnder Chest\n\nAt max, we would have 8 pages, with a 54 item page, and 7 36 item pages. This is relatively simple. We would do 54 + (7*36), or 306. We would then multiply 306 by 11943936000 or (306*11943936000). This would equal 3.6548444e+12 (dw I'm simplifying at the end), or a total of 4.0728822e+12.\n\nAccessory Bag\n\nI've done the math here, and I realized that the Personal Compactor 6000 is the most material dense, with a total of 1351680 items per, as opposed to the cake bags 54. I have run the numbers and 1351680 is in fact greater than 54. So we multiply 1351680 by 57 and we get 77045760. Add that to our total and we have a new total of 4.0729592e+12.\n\nFishing Bag\n\nFor the fishing bag, we have 45 slots, of which can store 64 enchanted cooked fish each, and (45*(64*(160*(160)))), or 73728000 items. 73728000 + 4.0729592e+12 = 4.0730329e+12 \n\nQuiver\n\nOur quiver has 45 slots, and an arrow is comprised of 3 materials (flint, stick, feather), and we can fit 64 arrows a stack. 64*45*3 = 8640, and thus equals 4.0730329e+12.\n\nSack Of Sacks\n\nThe most material rich sack is the mining stack, with 15 different materials per sack. It can store 20160 of each material, and we can fit 22 of these sacks in a sack of sacks. 15*20160*22 = 6652800, or a new total of 4.0730396e+12.\n\nPet\n\nThe most item dense item is the legendary griffin, with around 3800000 items. Add this to our previous total and we have 4.0730434e+12.\n\nWardrobe\n\nOkay, so the first thing we would do is obviously is wear the backpacks on our heads. For the other pieces, it gets interesting. The most material dense armour is 3/4 perfect with the previously mentioned jumbo backpack on your head. It would be about 11947936000 per wardrobe slot, and with 18 wardrobe slots, we would have 215062848000, which we would add to our total, getting a new total of 4.2881062e+12. Good. \n\nThe Island\n\nAlright. For this, we'll be figuring out the number of items we can store on our island. Anything we've already done will pale in comparison to this. The dimensions of an island at max upgrade is 241 x 256 x 241, or 14868736. That's good. We know that you can fit 27 items in a chest, and each chest takes up 1 block, meaning we would have 401455872 available slots on our island for backpacks. We would then multiply 401455872*11943936000, for a total of 4.7949632e+18 items in our island. We would then add our previous total and end up with 4.7949675e+18 as our new total. Great. We're almost done. Next up...\n\nProfiles\n\nThis one is pretty simple to calculate. Assuming we're a youtube rank, we would have 5 profiles. 5*4.7949675e+18 = 2.3974838e+19. 2.3974838e+19 is our total. \n\nConclusion\n\n23974838000000000000 items. This is the maximum amount of items a skyblock player can store at once. That's a lot of items. Thank you for reading, please like if you found this helpful as it took me 2 hours and a lot of pain.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: TLDR\n\n\n\n23974838000000000000 items."

On Tuesday I made a forum post about reviving the FurfSky+ texture pack, and after gathering 8 artists who I believed had the capabilities to make super high quality textures, I'm excited to announce that we've made progress.

I have an idea that might help give these guys some use. After all, there are 5 classes for a reason. This is a suggestion for mainly higher floors where (im guessing) insanely high ehp will be needed so all those nerds in full sa will be irrelevant and become the new nons of the forums. This is kinda a hybrid between tank and healer but who cares.\n\nCurrently an area that hasnt gotten much love (thank the devs for this train wreck of a niche of the mage class) is necromancy. Most people know how it works. This isnt directly necromancy but similar. I propose something like a staff (idfk how to come up with names) that spawns 5 of those little bezerk guys that run to your teamates and tank for them. They would have like a limited health but could give your teammates time to heal or something. Another thing for healer could be basically the same idea but the little dudes run to your teammates and throw like 3 healer circles (1 every 5 seconds) on the person specifically. To make this not broken, if these circles are stacked, similar to owoflux, only one would work. After those 15 seconds they would be eliminated and forced to live in the shadow realm. This could prob have like a cooldown of 1 minute or something."

    "title": "Honest Question for F6-Rushers",
    "body": "Many of the best dungeons players right now are using what we can call the F6-rush strategy: queue for entrance, wait till your party fills up with noobs, then enter Floor 6 instead. All the noobs will get kicked (because they don't have F5 completion), and you'll have the floor to yourself.*\n\nThe point of this strategy, as far as I can tell, is that you won't have to share any of the loot (flowers, livid frags, etc.), and you will get a ton of combat experience.\n\nThat brings me to my question: if this is what you want to get out of an F6 rush, why do you kick mid-level players who join your parties? Honest question!\n\nIf someone with a Cata Level of, say, 14 joins your party, they certainly aren't going to compete with you for loot or combat experience. If anything, they might lower your grade for the floor, but that isn't what you were going for (as far as I can tell). So why kick a mid-level player who joins your party?\n\nMaybe you just enjoy the feeling of having a dungeon to yourself. Maybe you look down on mid-level players. Maybe you actually care about your grade for that run. Who knows? I don't, which is why I am asking. I would be grateful if you would fill me in!\n\n(Full disclosure: I accidentally tagged along once on an F6 rush. I wanted to test a new setup so I joined an entrance party, and then found myself in floor 6 with a very surprised late-game player. It was a nice break in the grind, so I thought it might be fun to tag along again sometime. Obviously I would behave myself--I'd hang back and pick up enough scraps to hit my milestones, but I wouldn't do anything to ruin the run. Or so it seems to me!)\n\n*I do think this is a bit of a crummy thing to do to unsuspecting noobs, for whatever that's worth. For one thing, you're costing them a few minutes of their time (since they will now have to find another party after waiting with you to enter a dungeon, only to get kicked). For another, you're falsely getting their hopes up--\"yay, I'm going in with a level 30 mage this time!\"--which seems kinda crummy, too. But I don't want to get into the ethics of F6 runs here, not least because there isn't anything crummy about kicking a mid-level player who knows very well what you're doing."

    "body": "Hello! My idea that I would like Hypixel Skyblock is \"Ability Merging\". What this idea does is that in a special anvil you would put to items into the slots and merge them together. But it would cost 1-50m depending on them item's rarity. For example if you have a Hunters Knife and a Rogue sword and you were to put the Hunters knife before the rogue sword in the special anvil it would look something like this...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make this balanced you would not be able to merge different mage abilitys such as bonzo/frozen scythe and the damage would be reduced by 10-50% depending on the rarity.This would cost 5million skyblock coins to merge. After merging there is is a nothing special anvil that you can use to set it back to normal and get the 2 items back. This would cost 1-50m depending on the item too! Please give me your feedback about if the community likes this idea. Please add this to the game. TY <3"

    "body": "as a tank in dungeons, should i get bee, blu whale, or turdle\n\n\n\nSpoiler: bonus bee movie script\n\n\n\nAccording to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! \"What's the difference?\" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody \"dawg\"! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? \"You like jazz?\" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. \"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, \"Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?\" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your \"experience.\" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. \"They make the honey, and we make the money\"? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Ohung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, \"I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this\"? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, \"Honey, I'm home,\" without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Oase number 4475, Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice! Oall your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn't hear you. - No. - No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police. But you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games. - What's that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're bluffing. - Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... ...bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Oould you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee. Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or non?\" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean? We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... But it's just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. Oan't breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming! - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down. Shut down honey production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Oannonball! We're shutting honey production! Mission abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base. Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there. Oh, yeah? What's going on? Where is everybody? - Are they out celebrating? - They're home. They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket. At least we got our honey back. Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now... Now I can't. I don't understand why they're not happy. I thought their lives would be better! They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people. You don't have any idea what's going on, do you? - What did you want to show me? - This. What happened here? That is not the half of it. Oh, no. Oh, my. They're all wilting. Doesn't look very good, does it? No. And whose fault do you think that is? You know, I'm gonna guess bees. Bees? Specifically, me. I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things. It's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees. That's our whole SAT test right there. Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... The human species? So if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it? I know this is also partly my fault. How about a suicide pact? How do we do it? - I'll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice. Right, right. Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going. I had to open my mouth and talk. Vanessa? Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going? To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena. They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying. It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it. Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this. I know. Me neither. Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports. Wait a minute. Roses. Roses? Roses! Vanessa! Roses?! Barry? - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are. Flowers, bees, pollen! I know. That's why this is the last parade. Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down? Oould you slow down? Barry! OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault. Yes, it kind of is. I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse. Actually, it's completely closed down. I thought maybe you were remodeling. But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined. I don't want to hear it! All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park. All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got. - Bees. - Park. - Pollen! - Flowers. - Repollination! - Across the nation! Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia. They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy. Security will be tight. I have an idea. Vanessa Bloome, FTD. Official floral business. It's real. Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch. Thank you. It was a gift. Once inside, we just pick the right float. How about The Princess and the Pea? I could be the princess, and you could be the pea! Yes, I got it. - Where should I sit? - What are you? - I believe I'm the pea. - The pea? It goes under the mattresses. - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal. You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco! Let's see what this baby'll do. Hey, what are you doing?! Then all we do is blend in with traffic... ...without arousing suspicion. Once at the airport, there's no stopping us. Stop! Security. - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes. Has it been in your possession the entire time? Would you remove your shoes? - Remove your stinger. - It's part of me. I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job. Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job! I think this is gonna work. It's got to work. Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott. We have a bit of bad weather in New York. It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay. Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it. I gotta get up there and talk to them. Be careful. Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer. Oaptain, I'm in a real situation. - What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing. Bee! Don't freak out! My entire species... What are you doing? - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney! - Who's an attorney? Don't move. Oh, Barry. Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit? And please hurry! What happened here? There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded. One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious! - Is that another bee joke? - No! No one's flying the plane! This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status? This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York. Where's the pilot? He's unconscious, and so is the copilot. Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience? As a matter of fact, there is. - Who's that? - Barry Benson. From the honey trial?! Oh, great. Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee. It's got giant wings, huge engines. I can't fly a plane. - Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot? - Yes. How hard could it be? Wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning. This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing. Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory... That's Barry! ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew. Flowers?! We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience. Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane. I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres. They've done enough damage. But isn't he your only hope? Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all. Their wings are too small... Haven't we heard this a million times? \"The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.\" - Get this on the air! - Got it. - Stand by. - We're going live. The way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. That's why I want to get bees back to working together. That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O. We get behind a fellow. - Black and yellow! - Hello! Left, right, down, hover. - Hover? - Forget hover. This isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep! Barry, what happened?! Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time. - That may have been helping me. - And now we're not! So it turns out I cannot fly a plane. All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out! Move out! Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane! Don't have to yell. I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble. It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice! It's not a tone. I'm panicking! I can't do this! Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it! You snap out of it. You snap out of it. - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - Hold it! - Why? Oome on, it's my turn. How is the plane flying? I don't know. Hello? Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there? The Pollen Jocks! They do get behind a fellow. - Black and yellow. - Hello. All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop. Where? I can't see anything. Oan you? No, nothing. It's all cloudy. Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry. - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something. - What? - I don't know. It's strong, pulling me. Like a 27-million-year-old instinct. Bring the nose down. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! - What in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! - Vanessa, aim for the flower. - OK. Out the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys? Affirmative! Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it. Land on that flower! Ready? Full reverse! Spin it around! - Not that flower! The other one! - Which one? - That flower. - I'm aiming at the flower! That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower made of millions of bees! Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up. Rotate around it. - This is insane, Barry! - This's the only way I know how to fly. Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern? Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse! Just drop it. Be a part of it. Aim for the center! Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman! Oome on, already. Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly! - Yes. No high-five! - Right. Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower? What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius! - Thank you. - But we're not done yet. Listen, everyone! This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth. That means this is our last chance. We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this. If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say? Are we going to be bees, orjust Museum of Natural History keychains? We're bees! Keychain! Then follow me! Except Keychain. Hold on, Barry. Here. You've earned this. Yeah! I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves. Oh, yeah. That's our Barry. Mom! The bees are back! If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time. I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight! Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Oan I help who's next? Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don't forget these. Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. And I don't see a nickel! Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat! I had no idea. Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment? Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you. Sorry I'm late. He's a lawyer too? I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase. Have a great afternoon! Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere. No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me. You're a lifesaver, Barry. Oan I help who's next? All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly. Thank you, Barry! That bee is living my life! Let it go, Kenny. - When will this nightmare end?! - Let it all go. - Beautiful day to fly. - Sure is. Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office. You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. - Thinking bee! - Me? Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Oan we stop here? I'm not making a major life decision during a production number! All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys. I had virtually no rehearsal for that."

It's going to dig an even bigger gap between endgame players & players who are mid to late game ( even starters ). Endgame people will have farming 50 and a lv100 legendary elephant and beat the living s*** out of the people with lower farming level. But if you want to stand a chance to beat them, you need higher tier hoes but to get the higher tier hoe, you need a gold medal which you cannot get because high farming level people are gonna beat you.

I got my vampire fang during the previous event and I decided to put it on my pet (it was a huge mistake). I was excited when I saw these stats because I thought that it's the best pet for spooky fishing. Then I tested dolphin and bat pet for spooky fishing - I was disappointed with the test results:\n\nI cought 150 sc with dolphin and bat pets ('+' is a spooky mob, '-' is just a common sea creature mob). 65 of the 150 sc were spooky mobs (dolphin + spooky bait) [this is 43%] and 55 of the 150 sc were spooky mobs (mythic bat + spooky bait) [36-37%]. Bat pet should've given 60-70% spooky mobs (not just 40%) so I can conclude that a mythic bat pet is bugged and doesn't work with a spooky bait (I think 150 sc is enough to make conclusion). It makes this pet trash because I don't see the point to use this pet with another bait since a dolphin pet is better with a spooky bait than a bat with a fish|whale bait. I heard that auger rod doesn't work with an ice bait and maybe bat + spooky bait is the same problem.\nI should've made this post right after the previous event but I was slightly lazy \n\nTL DR\nBat pet is broken and the last perk (Sonar) doesn't work with a spooky bait"

He tries to make friends with you and waits a couple of months and be like a cool guy. But then later he asks to borrow items to test them out or test something else. I was getting sus of him after he asked for more items.  Then just start collecting more and more stuff from you and then he says that add him to your coop to get items back. That's where you are doomed and you lost all your items. If you add him he just grief you and collects the rest of the items for himself somehow. So when he asked to add him to COOP, that's where I got sus of him even more and started investigating. And yea, I lost my armor cause of that, but I hope it's a good sacrifice. \nI found a couple of nicknames of people what he scammed and he is still in coop with the last successful victim. If you have any info about that guy or you saw him trying to scam someone or you been scammed by him. You can report it to the staff. \n\nThat guy IGN: ImSirius_ \n\nI'm asking about this, cause it's more than scamming, that guy makes people leave the game and SkyBlock or even the whole Hypixel server. That is harming the server and the server is losing potential customers. There are more people like that, so if we report this kinda people with good evidence, we make servers better for everyone and we can actually get more people in this wonderful game mode. \n\nPS.

The mythic Midas pet is the same as the legendary Midas pet, but with one more ability. On base, it gives +50 defense, +50 strength, and +30% crit damage.

    "body": "INTRODUCTION: necromancer sword , a f6 drop , which is about 4~5M in ah. it has 250 base dmg , 125 strength and 125 defence , according to \"hypixel fandom\" , can store soul from undead tag mobs (except bosses) .\n\nWHY IT IS UNDERATED??\nfrom its price in auction house , at 06/11 7:00pm , its just 5M in lowest bin , which is quite shocking because compared to \"shadow fury \" , regarded as \"the best weapon\" , the necromancer sword is just have (50 dmg less) . WHILE WE JUST DONT TALK ABOUT THE SHADOW FURY ABILITY FIRST , regard on the \" RAISE SOUL\" ability , if you have absorbed a \"mimic soul \" or \"spirit bear soul\" they deal 40k per second (due to high attack speed) and if you are in full necromancer armour , the dmg per second (WITHOUT THE SWORD ) is 40k*6 = 240k\n\nNECROMANCER SWORD DEALS 240k DMG more in its ability ,\n\nthe dmg of two sword if not include necromancy mobs , shadow fury better => better than necromancer sword JUST FOR 50 dmg\n\nhowever , when the ability of the necromancer sword is counted , which is 240k more at its best mob whihc can absorb in 6/11 2020\n\nSHADOW FURY is NOT as GOOD as the NECROMANCER SWORD (unless your above catacomb 37)(calculated)\n\ndue to the shadow fury just have 50 more damage but necromancer mob deals 240k per sec\n\nWHAT adds insult to injury is that ----- Shadow Fury , a 50 more damage weapon , is 25M higher than the necromancer sword\n\nHOWEVER , inspite of the shadow fury ability , it is believed to be useful to shadow fury users can rapid teleport and hit 5 mob in a 10 block radius\nwhich is the catchy point of the shadow fury , worth 25M more coins.\n\nbut when it comes down to use , the rapid teleport is not efficient , which can welly replaced by the spirit scupture , whihc worth 28M recently , recorded in 6/11 2020 .\n\nIN THE NUT SHELL ,\n1)shadow fury better than necromancer sword JUST FOR 50 dmg\n2)SHADOW FURY is NOT as GOOD as the NECROMANCER SWORD (unless your above catacomb 37)(calculated)\n3)Shadow Fury , a 50 more damage weapon , is 25M higher than the necromancer sword\nwhich those coins can be used to buy spirit scupture , whihc worth 28M recently , recorded in 6/11 2020 .\n\nNECROMANCER SWORD IS UNDERATED SOOOOOOOOO MUCH , with its low price , high dmg stat\n\nSHADOW FURY IS TOOOOOOOO OVER PAID , WHICH DIDNT DESERVE THE PRICE\nTHE 25M extra can be used to buy spirit scupture , or other items .\n\nreported by a skyblock player , thanks for watching . bump will be appreciated.\nAlso for those who think giant sword is the best sword , I will make a full threat tomorrow , but I had made a tiny brief one down read it if you want .\n\n\nSKYBLOCK_FACTs said:\n\n\n\nI think it\u2019s a misunderstood, giant is not as good as necromanc r sword I\u2019ll show in other thread sry , I can briefly conclude why the giant sword actually so bad unless your in full sa , which make it slightly better than necromancer sword but not the shadow fury . First , the raw damage is calculated by (damage + 5 +(strength/5))*((strength /100)+1) which can be found at wiki the strength /100 gives 2 times multiply and the first part , damage + strength/5 can conclude having 275 dmg having raw damage when max hpb and using blaze pet , necromancer sword is result of having 1003 raw damage , and the giant sword , which u believe is the best sword in the game , can be calculated have a 923.2 raw damage .However , when the player kills sooooo many mob like 300 mob is as set , let\u2019s see how much the damage goes for ! The raw dmg of the necromancer sword is 2410.2 dmg , and giant sword have 2930 dmg . Which it soon outclasses the necromancer sword . However , is it the best sword in game? You might forgotten the shadow fury , which had either good dmg and strength. however I cannot explain so much deal to a limit of time , sorry . I will explain tomorrow \n\nlook up lol seem same question.\n[/QUOTE\n\nClick to expand..."

    "title": "Ideas for Ironman",
    "body": "Just wanted to share some thoughts on what they should add to ironman profiles.\n1) A way to give gifts.\n\n\nSpoiler: How could they add this\n\n\n\nThe devs could code it so that you can only give and not receive gifts. It shouldn't be too hard, it would be similar to disabling item pickups. Snow minions are a great source of money when you have limited methods as well as a great source of diamonds. Perfect Tier 12 takes very long to grind even with snow minions, but at least they are much more effective. As for exp boosts, they are necessary for anybody who wants 50 skill avg. It already takes months per skill, this would greatly speed up the process for iron man profiles.\n\n\n2) Remove npc buy limit.\n\n\nSpoiler: How could they add this\n\n\n\nIt's simple, just make the code for an iron man profile the same as it used to be. There really is no point of the buy limit when you can't resell to bazaar but I can also understand why it's in the game.\n\n\n3) Make there a way to get booster cookies.\n\n\nSpoiler: How could they add this\n\n\n\nThey could make a new npc that sells them very overpriced. Maybe make him sell at 2mil so people don't flip them and only buy one every day or 4 days. Furthermore, they could make it so only iron man players can interact with him.\n\n\n4) If there are no booster cookies, at least make bits easier to obtain.\n\n\nSpoiler: How could they add this\n\n\n\nI think you can get bits in dungeons, but I may be wrong. My idea for adding bits would be on each skill level you get some, scaling just like coins scale. This would mean they are limited so bits items are more valuable automatically. You could also get rewarded bits on each npc purchase, and contribution to community projects. If you do though, the npc buy limit might have to stay.\n\n\n5) Make mage a more viable class.\n\n\nSpoiler: How could they add this\n\n\n\nThe yeti sword is almost necessary and is ridiculously expensive. If you had one ice minion tier 11 working, it would take upwards of 5-6 years to fully make this. Even with 29, which is unrealistic because people need other minions for other things, it takes upwards of 2 months to just get all the ice. The iron blocks take about a week also. It's ridiculously expensive for an iron man player and unlike the midas staff, isn't buyable for a mage. This makes the game unbalanced because a smart player would just save up and buy the midas staff next time Scorpius is mayor again. It's better at almost every price point, but still insanely expensive. For a game mode with limited money making methods, it's almost impossible to play mage.\n\n\n5) Buff npc sell prices.\n\n\nSpoiler: How could they add this\n\n\n\nThis one is a must. Money is so hard to make on an iron man. It can screw you out of dungeon drops easily and overall is a pain. The only way to make money is through raider's, which isn't much, or farming and selling to the npc, which is barely more. To buff npc sell prices is a good fix in my opinion.\n\n\n\nAnyways, these are just suggestions. The only necessities are the gifts and bits or booster cookies and the others are just wishes mainly. If anyone else has ideas please respond, I'd love to hear them!"

This would be so useful for people who just need one pickaxe, and want to stick to the Stonk, which sadly is golden and not diamond. So the recipe would be 4 stacks of enchanted diamonds, one in each corner, and 32 enchanted gold filling each of the other corners being like 32, 32, 32, and 32, and a regular book in the middle\n\n(btw this is about the same price as dragon hunter, maybe a bit more, so on release this would skyrocket in price if it ever does but once it settles down, expect it to be a bit more than a dh1 book)"

    "body": "Never done a formal thread before, let\u2019s see how it goes\nHello, people of this game. As you know, playing one specific video game for long periods can cause you to lose interest in that game. I thought that if this were the case, you would want to do something else to fill the time that SkyBlock would normally fill. So, I have come up with a list of some things you should do if you were ever to get bored of SkyBlock. This is just my opinion, or something.\n5. Roguelikes \nSo, roguelikes are games that are pretty fun. There are many of them out there that don\u2019t cost a lot. Some examples being Noita, The Binding of Isaac, Soul Knight (suggested by SnowMinionT11), and Enter the Gungeon. They have a lot of strategy and many different play-styles for you to possible enjoy\n4. Going outside\nIn these circumstances, it might not bethe most accessible, but you should all give it a try sometime\n3. Hollow Knight\nin my opinion, this is one of the better games out there. It has good mechanics, great tmusic, and looks very nice. You should definitely give this game a try. \n2. A new hobby\nYou ever wanted to draw, or play a sport, or write a book. But you haven\u2019t had the time until now? Well, now you might have the time.\n1. Sleep\nTrust me, sleep is amazing. You need this more than anything else. \n\nWell that was it. Please leave feedback or something for my first formal thread."

The way to do this is do /coop add (friends name) but type this on your solo profile, and just like that it will then on be a co-op island. I don't know if this is reversible but I don't think it is if a admin is seeing this i hope they make it reversible or this could cause something bad for someone. So if any of you are adding people to a co-op make sure you are typing the command on your co-op profile."

When a player leaves the entire run can be very difficult, but still salvageable. If a player is actively trolling then it is a horrendous 1 hour experience. It is understandable that sometimes there are connection issues or other real world factors;m players who actively troll a dungeon ruin the entire experience\n\nRecently I've had dungeon runs where someone holds the entire team hostage. In my most recent, a member left the game and another decided to afk in a safe zone forcing us to 3 man F4. We could not collect our xp because we could not wipe, and we were already 70% cleared. Since I don't have a recording software, here are screenshots of ltzKlenO_0 sitting at fairy for almost 10 minutes while we cleared. It should be noted that this player actively trolled puzzles such as the ice room, and was afk in the fairy room before I realized and started taking screenshots. The run in question only ended when we cleared the entire dungeon and had the boss kill ltzKlenO_0 for us.\n\nI figure that there is nothing to be done against this player, but I do wish this kind of situation can be addressed. A vote kick option for a dungeon run would be one potential solution where the majority of the players votes to kick a player who is trolling or excessively afk."

    "body": "This is my alternate timeline in which I envision The Watcher like this I hope you enjoy reading! (Its an alternate timeline because the journals say otherwise)\n\nThe Watcher came from a time when the catacombs were not in control of Necron. The wither king made The Watcher to keep an eye on Necron. Necron knew that he could not kill The Watcher without getting serious consequences potentially ruining his chances of inheriting the catacombs from his father. \n\nNecron made The Watcher test adventurers dumb enough to come into the catacombs. The Watcher enjoyed making adventurers flee for their lives as to not waste Necron's time with the ones not strong enough to fight. The ones who got through The Watcher, always died to one of Necron's generals. The Watcher liked stalking the humans and messing with their brains. It was fascinated by how the humans dealt with the undead. It also thought the humans were weak. Most humans died to the undead. The Watcher stalked each group with great interest. The ones that did not die to the undead died to Bonzo. \n\nNecrons number one rule was to leave no survivors. The Watcher made sure of that by trapping and killing the ones that turned back. Eventually one human made their escape from the catacombs alive. But nobody believed them because the catacombs had been quiet for millennia, possibly even eons. Necron heard about this and told The Watcher they are lucky that it is under the wither kings protection otherwise it would have been smitten. The humans could have found out they were planning to take over the overworld too. Now they have to speed up the process. \n\nLore about the generals coming soon hopefully! I hope all you forumers enjoyed reading this considering I put some effort into this. I should probably make it more about the watcher instead of making a whole story behind it that will help with the transfer to Bonzo's storyline, but eventually I hope to put all of the generals stories as well as Necron's and the wither kings into one big story that seamlessly passes into each other. Anyway I hope you enjoyed the introduction! Keep an eye out for Bonzo's story if you liked this one! Also, please like the post if you enjoyed it, and give it a bump!\n\nEdited to add a bit of clarification\nEdit 2: Bonzo's Story is out make sure to check it out if you like this!

Then this happens 1 second later, and the goal is to hit 3 of them in a row. You can go anywhere in the room, but if you miss a shot, the counter resets. If you dont shoot, it doesnt reset. Basically, shoot 3 times, hit 3 times and you win, not every target that pops up has to be shot. A counter can be seen above the wall, with green stained clay meaning a hit, and red stained clay meaning the ones you still need in a row\n\n\nFear Mongerer miniboss thats totally not stolen from twilight forest's lich stage 1 [miniboss]\n\n\nSpoiler: fear mongerer miniboss thats totally not stolen from twilight forest's lich stage 1\n\n\n\nminiboss name: Fear Mongerer(the spooky fest trader person), only spawns in yellow rooms\nhp: 1 hp, dies in one hit, but has shields that circle around him. you cant attack him until all shields are down.\nhow fight work: 3 shields, makes him immune to damage until all 3 are down. He shoots candy lasers(just a visual) that can be hit back using an item you get by finishing the parkour in the room(quite easy, 5 jumps 4 blocks each(extra speed in dungeons makes them easy), cant use movement abilities(aote, grappler, spider boots, etc)). Lasers do 20% of hp, and give you slowness 3 for 5 seconds. Each time you get it, you can hit the lasers back at him, to destroy a shield every time you hit him with the lasers. I didnt steal this from twilight forest, 100% NOT stage 1 of the lich, so dont spam comments abt that.\ndrops candy core, used to upgrade candy artifact for an extra +10% + boosted rarity, as rng drop and 5 of each type of candy as 100% drop instead of essence.\n\n\nStorm fight\n\n\nSpoiler: Storm fight\n\n\n\nStorm (if someone wants to make storm phrases you can)\nStages: 5\nStage 1: air related: big platform above the arena, air related. Random \"winds\" blowing you off the edge, platform made of packed ice btw. You try surviving for EITHER 60 seconds without falling off, or until you kill the core in the middle, which is what is shooting winds at you. storm also occasionally strikes lightning, which destroys the ground there and also damages you for 100k damage if you get hit. you cant teleport once you fall off(death barrier is the same as the platform height).\n\nstage 2: fire related: speech \"hah you fools. While you were trying to survive in my mighty winds, they've been powering my fire, a fire that will rage, and tear through you!\"\nwhat you do: big fire that prevents you from seeing clearly, and you get randomly teleported inside it. Also does 2k ehp of damage per second. Random fire spirits pop up, which you have to kill, kinda like bonzo's mobs but you cant see them very clearly. in this fire, you have to try and find the middle, where the lever will be located to turn it off, you have to kill all the fire spirits before you can hit the lever. f5 doesnt help seeing.\n\nstage 3: earth related: speech \"AGGHHHH. Why did i leave that lever there? No matter. The lever you pulled may have stopped the fire, but it wont save you from this challenge!\nbasically, the ground stops you from healing every little stage you're in. deathrun but with fighting instead of parkour, so you're in an autoscroller that advances every time you finish the mobs in the stage. you fight until you get to the end to press yet ANOTHER lever. if you finish the stages and hit the lever without the wall hits you, you continue to the next stage without any debuffs. if the wall hits you, you'll go on to the next stage with the following deuffs: set speed to 100%, remove half of all blessings, rounded up when odd number, and finally a -20 second penalty on your breath bar/time when you get onto the water stage.\nstage 4: water related: speech when beat the parkour \"WHY DO I KEEP LEAVING LEVERS EVERYWHERE!?!?!?!? Doesnt matter, ILL JUST DROWN YOU INSTEAD!\"\nspeech when you didnt do the stages fast enough: \"Hah I knew you couldn't beat my marvelous arena! I'll send you a little GIFT just for failing. Prove your worth to me again by continuing this challenge with even LESS power than you had before.\" message in chat saying: you've lost half your blessings, and your speed has been set to 100%.\nyou then get teleported into a cage for 20 seconds if you failed the parkour\nwhat you do: basically, you have to try and survive by getting to the other side without drowning or dying. No abilities. You have to try to get to the other side, where there will be a hut to lead to a hole where storm is. Traps will try stopping you, so will some mobs.\n\nstage 5: fighting storm: speech \"fine burger this is. Wait how did you get in here???? I guess I'll have to finish you myself then! Get ready!\nstorm has 700m hp and shoots gusts of air that blow you around. Also shoots fireballs that do 90k dmg a hit, which are fairly easy to dodge. Sses the yeti sword ability too, and also makes the floor water occasionally. Nothing special. Once he gets down to 1m hp, he will start self destructing, doing 500k dmg when he blows up. Gets down to 1 hp, continues to attack, but you can hit him and kill him instantly. Not hitting him for 20 seconds results in him healing until he gets hit again\n\n\n\nplease give feedback thx"

The problem now is people killing the special zealots and standing on the eye until the pickup priority ends and they can take it. I know that a number of people have faced this issue and have gotten cheated out of eyes. I think there's an easy solution to this and it's to make it so that if you spawn a special zealot that you are the only person that can hit it for say 10 seconds or so. This would give you time to look around for the zealot and find it before someone could kill it and stand on the eye.\n\nThis would also make a good solution to people hitting another person's slayer boss. Maybe they could even make it a setting that you can toggle so that way if you have a friend who you want to help you with a slayer boss they can hit it.\n\nThese are both problems that lots of people deal with and I think this solution or something similar to it would save frustration, in-game money, and time (more for slayer bosses) for lots of people."

I love posting threads and replying to others while in school so I like to be here. In fact, This place may have pretty stupid people but they just make the forums family whole.\n\nHowever much I like tuning into the forums mobile, it could be better. Sometimes I wish I could get notification pings without having to use my email, and auto-correct should definitely be adapted to the forums where unnatural terms are used all the time.\n\nthese issues could definitely be fixed as long as provide actual support to mobile users. I propose that hypixel devote some of their funds to creating a hypixel app. This app would have connections to the forums, hypixel store, game info, announcements, and all the other pages o hypixel.net. I also think it should have systems that tie to useful fandom wikis and API viewers, especially for skyblock. These implementations could even be adapted to things like google play and desktop applications.\n\nwhat do you think? I\u2019m no app developer but this does seem like a useful idea. I could see myself using this all the time. Please vote on the poll for your opinion on the matters and comment any other ideas!"

    "body": "So we know for sure Marina isn't an actual citizen of the Hub or its (current) surrounding islands, and comes from what is implied to be the Abyss (promising to let us visit some day) and it's even possible her and the Melancholic Viking both come from the same place. Her income is probably legit, fishing and selling her catches.\n\nDiana sells Griffins and Ancestral Spades, but due to her abilities and knowledge on the topic of both pets and mythos she's likely a scholar. Her income probably comes from the stuff she sells as mayor (shovels produced by her, Griffins bred by her) along with her research papers and grants to further her studies.\n\nCole is a miner. He outright tells players he spends his time mining. Safe to assume his income is just from mining and selling his drops.\n\nDiaz seems to be associated with the normal auction, bank, and shop NPCs and they have a lot of money-based perks. I assume Diaz likely makes money off of Bazaar and AH flipping since they seem like the rich \"invest in stocks\" kinda person.\n\nPaul just grinds dungeons 24/7 when he's not mayor. Probably has a freakin' Diamond Necron head or something. The fact he is so skilled he can find TEN different secrets a floor, no matter the layout that NOBODY else can find implies a lot. Not to mention he's so rich he outright offers to pay 1/5 of dungeon chest's costs as mayor.\n\nFoxy seems to be the type of girl that schedules her life around the game and its events. She probably makes profit off of placing high in Spooky Festival, taking advantage of other mayor's events when she's not mayor, selling Oringo pets when others can't get on and miss them. And I imagine she has a full museum of every year cake in the game.\n\nAatrox seems to grind slayers A L O T though his intelligence is lacking. He probably just grinds Sven a ton and sells overfluxes bin at their lowest price for instant money. Still money, but not as much. I imagine Maddox lets Aatrox do slayers for free because they're related.\n\nBarry conjures money from hell.\n\nScorpius def makes his money off DA. They're paid off by Sirius so he can sell more stuff through his puppet mayor. Likely the richest of all of them due to the sheer fact Sirius is likely willing to do anything to get more business and he can give up to 1m to all players that vote for him.\n\nTo sum it up, the best money-making method is being an NPC. Have a wonderful day folks!"

Most mayors being irrelevant because their perks are awful compared to the event mayors. The alchemy skill being completely useless now because god potions are a thing, enchanting never being useful in the game at all.

No enemies in sight, but a distance of fear beneath.\nThe Portal ignited there without even a second, and we got out to avoid trouble...\nThe First Floor will be the solution to our army's mission. We got there immediately, slaughtered the crypts like animals and headed to the Blood Room again - This time, it was the same, but when we went in, things changed quite differently.\n\"Welcome back, adventurers. I know that you want to slaughter me again, but I won't make this happen anymore...\" Bonzo said. His sudden change of quotes shocked us with a flash of betrayal. The insane fight began. Bonzo seems different, he summoned balloons like usual, but they were a face of death, just black, and dynamites inside that killed us all...\n\"I won't tell you the pathway to our secrets...\"\nWe were kicked out of the dungeon as a punishment for our loss. We knew that this was not right, and we headed back to the lab again. No Scientists can explain the myth behind those changes to the dungeons. Maybe there were in fact, changing? Is it because of the humans that used to torture the dungeons? If not, then why would still, this would be happening? This is the future.\n\nThe next day as we entered the Second Floor, it was a sudden change and silence. That eye was not seen in the Blood room. This time around when we entered the boss room, we were in a spiral of moves. \nThe room was tainted with spider webs. There was a bed, and the blanket there had some stains. That student was still vomiting blood, that was black in colour. We were not mercy and immediately attacked him. However, that barely did any damage to him. It is just wasting our mana and giving him a chance to strike.\nSame again, that boy rose into the air, but this time he was higher. Dozens of dark spells overwhelmed us with fear. Lasers... we were wiped out in less than a second.\n\n\"Wait, this isn't Wither Skulls...\" Scarf said with a creepy voice. A smile appeared on his face. \n\nSomething must be wrong..."

    "body": "New Skill: Cooking\nCooking is a new skill that can be viewed from your skills menu. Cooking is increased\nby cooking with various ingredients with the gain will be dependent on the ingredients used\nin the cooking process.\n\n\n\n\n\nFoods are a secondary temporary buffed that can be applied to the player. The player\ncan only have one food buff at a time and the buffs vary depending on ingredient. Some\ningredients can give temporary stat increases, while other ingredients can give special\nabilities and effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen starting out on cooking, you are only limited to FOUR cooking slots. Players gain access\nto a new cooking slot every 10 levels, with level 50 unlocking the final slot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also a new house in the hub with a brand new NPC called \"Chef\"\n(I used a skin of myself as I couldn't find any players who had a chef skin). This NPC will\nintroduce you into the ways of cooking and offer you the crafting table.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Ignore barrier block)\n\nNew Item Type: Ingredient\nIngredients are a new type of item that can be obtained in several ways. Some ingredients\nare craftable, some ingredients are rare drops from mobs, some can be from special events, and much more. Each ingredient\nholds special properties that range from stat boosts to unique abilities. Each ingredient\nalso adds/reduces the duration of a food and players can only put three of the same ingredient in a meal.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n\n\n\n(Dropped from mining Shiny blocks in the End)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dropped from squids)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Extremely rare drop from Hydra)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Carrot Collection)\n\nObviously there are going to be a lot more ingredients, but these were just a few examples\nof ingredients that could be added to the game.\n\nFood buffs will stay even inside of dungeons and upon death. However, if you want to consume new food or\nget rid of your current buffs, there is the Digestion Pill. (Purchase for 100k in the alchemist npc)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo differentiate it from another minecraft server with a similar cooking system,\nthere are recipes that you can collect throughout Skyblock. Most of these recipes\nare able to be purchased from the Chef himself, while other recipes are hidden in collections,\nother NPC's, quests, and more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese recipes will allow you to create food that you desire in a shorter period of time. However, \nif you try creating something that you don't have the recipe for or the recipe doesn't exist entirely,\nyou are forced to go through longer periods of time to cook your meal.\n\n\nWhen cooking, you're tasked upon doing random minigames, getting good\nminigame scores will result in increased stats for your food, while failing\nthese minigames (or \"cooking process\") will result in a deduction in stats.\n\nSome examples are:\n\n\n\n\nClick a furnace that constantly teleports from one location to another,\nthe furnace disappears quickly and not clicking it will result in a lower food score.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is more of a timing minigame. The more closely you click the glass pane\nwhen your food is done cooking, the more additional stat bonuses your meal gives.\n\nThat's about it for now, if there's anything you want to add please comment below,\nThank you for reading\u200bChange Log:\n(27/10/2020) Fixed an error where it would display as level 16 instead of level 26 in the image where I hover over the cooking skills (Credit: @Caving_Lantern)\n\n(27/10/2020) Added Chef NPC\n\n(27/10/2020) Added something unique about cooking compared to a certain server.

    "body": "Counterpiece to @AwesomeJDrock\nHis Piece Here :\n\n\nAwesomeJDrock said:\n\n\n\nEveryone is always complaining about being scammed, scammers say it\u2019s allowed. There isn\u2019t really a straight answer to what scamming is in the skyblock community. Here is my opinion on what is scamming and what is not.\n\nSCAMS ARE YOUR OWN FAULT\n\nOn ah if someone puts a lvl 4 book instead of 6 for a high price it\u2019s not a scam just look at what he is \u201cactually\u201d selling.\nif someone is starring your dungeon item that is trust to get someone to upgrade it, then be given a free item in return Coins).\nall trade \u201dscams\u201d are not scams whatever someone puts in the trade menu is what you get what you put is is what you give, use of backpacks mean you get a backpack, assume Nothing is in it. Trades are not scams as You get what you see and give what you see, the only way to get scammed is giving free items (for nothing in a trade) then asking for a third party request such as starring a dungeon item or crafting a pet etc. if You do third party trading aside from the trade menu then that isn\u2019t hypixels fault. And 100% of the time you just need to ask for a coallateral item or coins. I\u2019m not saying it is ok to \u201cscam\u201d or that \u201cscammers\u201c are doing nothing wrong I\u2019m just saying if you trade how your meant to trade there would be no issues with \u201cscams\u201d.\n\nthis is just my opinion, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m a \u201dscammer\u201d Just tired of hear \u201cI gOt ScAmMeD pLeAsE hElP\u201d\n\nplease tell me your opinions and let me know if you agree with me\n\nClick to expand...\n\nI agree with somewhat, but not all. I'll explain.\n\nTo start off, I'll bring up an example. Let's say you are approaching a red light. Your friend is right next to you. You don't want to run the red light, but your friend keeps telling you that it's fine. \"You'll make it! It's fine.\" You run the red light and crash into a limousine. Whose fault is it?\n\nThis is my general sentiment. Both you and your friend are at fault, now, AwesomeJDRock did not explicitly say that the scammer is not at fault, but the tone here was very much that most of the blame was on the victim, which I do not agree with.\nFor his first example, he says, \"On ah if someone puts a lvl 4 book instead of 6 for a high price it\u2019s not a scam just look at what he is \u201cactually\u201d selling.\" The thing is, most of these times, he is telling you he is selling a lvl 6 book. This fits perfectly into my above example. You did it, but he was influencing you.\n\nFor his second example he says, \"if someone is starring your dungeon item that is trust to get someone to upgrade it, then be given a free item in return Coins).\" The scammer is most of these times saying he will give it back, or says he will give like a livid dagger, but gives instead a iron sword. Again, you did it, but he influenced you.\n\nFor his third example(which confused me a bit?), he says, \"all trade \u201dscams\u201d are not scams whatever someone puts in the trade menu is what you get what you put is is what you give, use of backpacks mean you get a backpack, assume Nothing is in it. Trades are not scams as You get what you see and give what you see, the only way to get scammed is giving free items (for nothing in a trade) then asking for a third party request such as starring a dungeon item or crafting a pet etc. if You do third party trading aside from the trade menu then that isn\u2019t hypixels fault. And 100% of the time you just need to ask for a coallateral item or coins. I\u2019m not saying it is ok to \u201cscam\u201d or that \u201cscammers\u201c are doing nothing wrong I\u2019m just saying if you trade how your meant to trade there would be no issues with \u201cscams\u201d. if someone is starring your dungeon item that is trust to get someone to upgrade it, then be given a free item in return Coins).\" So first, he says that trade \"scams\" are not scams. This is true only if the scammer says nothing false or misleading. If he says he will give it back and doesn't, that's a scam. If he says he will give enchanted porkchops but gives rev viscera, that is false and a scam. Other than that, I generally agree for this point.\n\nSide Note : Hypixel Skyblock's playerbase is on the younger side, so their brains are more susceptible to manipulation, which is another reason they shouldn't be bashed on too much."

I'm at the stage where I'm trying to one shot the endermen outside the gate. So, I bought the raider axe, went for enchantments like ender slayer v, critical v, life steal III, what not. Now I have no idea how to combine the books in a way that doesn't cost so many levels, but after looking through several posts on the forums, I can't find any updated stuff. So I just went with it and tried not to mess it up. Ok, final book costs 57 levels. When I went to combine the axe with the final book, it costed 84 levels. Now here's where I messed up. After a while of getting xp, I went back to combine the axe and book. What I didn't realize was I left the raider axe on my island and the axe that was in my enderchest was a sweet axe. I didn't even read the name before combining enchantments and all I got out of it was efficiency 5 and telekinesis 1."

Also, this enchant works with Renowned)\nSuperior Force I books have a 1% chance to drop from Superior Dragons and Pray RNGesus odds for all the other dragons\n\nNew Weapon Enchant: Might\nGrants 5 additional Strength to the weapon per level\nObtainable from killing Minotaurs, and level 6 can be obtained from DA\n\nNew Accessory: Wealth Shrine (Legendary Accessory)\nUpgrade of Seal of the Family, costs 50 million coins and 20 items from DA, but reduces prices of most NPC stores, including DA, by 20% percent. (So if you bought a Midas Staff for 100 mil, you would only pay 80 mil, while getting the 100 mil bonus). \n\nNew Accessory: Skills Artifact (Epic Accessory)\nThis accessory increases Skill XP you get by 30% (Catacombs included), but the buff only applies to the Skill which you have the most XP in. For example, if you had the most Mining XP, you would get 30% more Mining XP. Automatically awarded when you get a level 30 Skill. (Excluding Carpentry)\n\nTell me what you think of these ideas!"

How do we spend the 2mil?\n\nThe Solution:\n\nFirst, we take the budget and see what we can improve.\nThen, take the standard damage output of the non.\n\nLets say DMG=7000\nBudget=2 Million.\n\nOur goal for damage is 20k+\n\nSo we can either do\nBudget-Armor\nBudget-Weapon\nBudget-Talismans.\n\nbut we can also do\nBudget-(Armor+Talismans).\n\nLet\u2019s say Strong Dragon Armor costs 1.1Mil.\nThe cheapest set of talismans cost 780k\nThe best weapon costs 1.5 mil.\n\nWhat is the best solution, you may ask?\n\nThe anwser is a better weapon.\n\n\u201dBut Weapons are just the best!\u201d-You may say.\n\nHere are the reasons why a Weapon fits us better.\n\n1.Lets say that reforging those new talismans takes 300k from the bank (due to being unlucky).\n\nThat is 1.08Million coins.\n\nLets say that after reforging them to Hurtful you gain 55% CD (This is unlikely, but this is a theory, not a concrete status)\n\nThe Sword costed 50k to reforge (unlucky) and 600k to enchant.\n\nLets compare our final scores.\nWeapon:2150000 coins (OVER BUDGET)\nTalismans:1080000 coins (LOTS OF SPARE MONEY)\nArmor:1100000 coins (SPARE MONEY)\n\nAs you can see, the weapons does go out of budget, while the Talismans don\u2019t.\n\n\u201dWhat about armor, huh, smartass?\u201d\n\nWell, armor is way to easily outclassed.\n\nLets compare old Strong Dragon prices to new ones.\n\nOld prices:5Million\nNew prices:1.1Million.\n\n1.1<5\n\nWhy did this happen? \nArmor gets outclassed easily. Easier than weapons.\n\nLets compare that to 3/4 SA and strong chestplate.\n\nStrong:1.1 (Million)\nSA+Strong Chestplate 6.6 (Million)\n\n1.1<6.6\n\nNow as you can see, a set with simmilar, hell, even better stats exists. Now I am not saying Strong isn\u2019t necesarry, it absolutely is, but for people that need damage, talismans should be a priority.\n\nSo, for damage progression\n\nWeapons<Armor<Talismans<FAIRY SOULS\n\nNow, many people do know this, but many people don\u2019t. Also, this was made to waste my and your time.\n\nWARNING:THIS IS JUST A THEORY, AND IS MOST LIKELY INCORRECT."

It's my favourite skyblock texture pack because the textures just look so clean and accurate to what I would imagine swords would look like, and some of the textures have really nice animations.

I tried to reach out to Furf a month ago to get permission to do something like this, but I didn't get a reply so I'm going to proceed with caution and do it anyway, and @FurfNSFW if you see this and don't want people to extend your work, then let me know and I'll stop it.\n\nSo the plan is, anyone who is interested please let me know in forum messages. Furf is the only skyblock pack I truly like, and with a collaborative effort of a lot of artists, between you, you can make an unofficial extension of the pack. I unfortunately have the artisitic talent of a doorknob so I won't be able to help a lot here, but if you feel you have what it takes to make a super clean. super vibrant 16x skyblock texture pack then please get in touch with me, and let's extend the best skyblock texture pack the world has ever seen.\n\nEDIT: Start a forums convo with me if you're interested\n\n(P.S. 32x packs all look awful)"

Meanwhile, if supply < demand is going on the price of it will increase, but the only sources to legit produce booster cookie is to buy it gem store which cost u irl money. And the price of a cookie is so damn high with about ~2.99 USD just for 1mil coin. Therefore no one is buying cookie and the supply of cookie become less.\n\nThe demand of cookie is insanely high and only a few (not many) peoples is paying gem for cookie and sell to bazaar. So then, the price of it will keep rising until a stable supply of cookie appeared.\n\n\nIdea:\n1. Add a recipe of booster cookie\n2. increase booster cookie duration"

    "body": "Short intro:\nI'm making this thread to spread awareness and gather support, since it's the only thing I'm able to do anymore. I'm unsure if staff will assist me. I'm not a YouTuber or close friend, so I certainly don't matter to them as much. \n\nStorytime: I don't know what sort of luck this is but a friend of mine has officially and suspiciously lost two expensive swords due to this same glitch. First time was a 80 mil Midas, this time was a 60 mil Shadow Fury, plus a couple 20 mil worth of other junk like frags. Total of 160 mil coins lost. Gross.\n\nDetails (how to avoid the glitch):\nWhenever you drag an item (manual move) through an inventory menu instead of shift-click (quick move) it, the item has a chance of disappearing or dropping when you put it down (despite you setting it so that the item cannot be dropped). Happens regardless of whether you're using backpacks, ender chests, chests, or your own player inventory.\nAs a general rule of thumb, try not to ever pick up and drag an item while in inventories that don't require it, especially if your ping is unstable. Skyblock servers are very iffy as they already are. If you end up losing an item, drag another item to the spot where the missing item should be, and hopefully the server corrects itself. What you shouldn't do is move lobbies while the item is missing, since it risks losing the item for good.\n\nTL;DR - always shift-click items instead of dragging them.\n\nPossible explanation is that you lag out and the item does too, since it doesn't even go to your island's Jerry. Other explanation is the item accidentally dupes, and the server's counter-measures against duping decide \"yeah this innocent player deserves his hard work to be deleted.\"\n\nTo conclude:\nThis obviously isn't the only item wipe glitch we know about, but it's the most memorable that we've experienced. This also isn't even the most BS thing that's happened to my friend, so just imagine what's going through their mind every time they log back on Hypixel and remember they bought a rank and paid an investment into this dirty treatment.\nHe's a noble, loyal player, and it sucks to see this happen. Now whether or not Hypixel does anything at all to help or even fix this glitch is beyond me. I'm not even sure if they can fix it, so for now everyone just stay careful, and rip your F's or similar stories in the replies."

    "body": "\u200b\n\n\nBy Cillian96470\nNew Year Cake Market Analyst\nJune 9th, 2020\n\nSkyblock New Year Cakes have been given out every skyblock year to reward players for being online every five days. These cake rewards have helped create a new emerging market focused on selling and buying cakes. This article will explain seven critical factors to the New Year Cake Market that explains cake prices and rarity of cakes.\n\nAverage Prices on Cake Auction (Shown in Table)\nAverage Prices from a Cake Collector (Shown in Table)\nRarity of every New Years Cake (Shown in Table)\nGraphs of the New Years Cakes\nDebate on whether to buy from auction or cake collector\nMain competitors\nThe Present New Year Cake Market\nQuestions\n\n\nBelow are the definitions for each factor shown in the Table\n\n\nAverage Prices on Cake Auction:\nThis means how much on average it would cost to buy certain New Year Cake on auction\n\nAverage Prices from a Cake Collector:\nA cake collector is someone that collects cakes every day in order to resell them either on auction or to individual players. These would be the prices that a cake collector would sell to an individual or on auction.\n\nRarity of every New Years Cake:\nI have categorized every cake into 4 different sections shown below.\n\n\nLegendary\nEpic\nRare\nCommon\n\nLegendary:\nThis is the hardest cake to find on auction, which would be between 2-4 weeks to find. These cakes include 2, 15, 19, 22, 45, 46. The reason they are hard to find is because they were 1. released at midnight in the US (15, 19), 2. the server was down for maintenance (22, 45, 46) 3. Players without ranks could not join, 4. They are popular because they are the most difficult cake to get (2). These are the four reasons why they are hard to get. The prices ranges from 1.4 million-4.2 million\n\nEpic:\nThese cakes are the second hardest to find on auction, which would be 1-2 weeks to find. These cakes include 9, 16, 33, 34. The reason they are hard to get is because 1. they were released at midnight, 2. Not having enough players online to grab the cakes 3. Hard to find on auction and on average more expensive. These are the three reasons why they are hard to get. The prices range from 750k-2.2 million.\n\nRare:\nThese cakes are easier to find on auction with medium difficulty, which would only take 1-2 days. These cakes are normally below New Year Cake 30 and making it rare increases their price. The price ranges from 250k-3.6 million.\n\nCommon:\nThese cakes are normally above New Year cake 30 and in less than an hour looking through the auction house. The average cost of these cakes range from 50k-250k and many people have these cakes.\n\nBelow are all cakes prices for buying, selling and the rarity of the cake\n\nJune 9th, 2020 prices\n\n\n\nSpoiler: New Year Cakes from 1-10\n\n\n\n\n\nCake YearBuying From AuctionSelling As a cake collectorRarity of the Cake1$1,150,000$2,000,000Rare2$2,500,000$4,200,000Legendary3$1,900,000$3,600,000Rare4$1,500,000$2,900,000Rare5$1,250,000$2,600,000Rare6$1,050,000$2,400,000Rare7$920,000$2,200,000Rare8$900,000$2,100,000Rare9$880,000$2,250,000Epic10$850,000$1,600,000Rare\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: New Year Cakes from 11-20\n\n\n\n\n\nCake YearBuying From AuctionSelling As a cake collectorRarity of the Cake11$720,000$1,500,000Rare12$670,000$1,300,000Rare13$620,000$1,200,000Rare14$570,000$1,100,000Epic15$1,100,000$1,600,000Legendary16$780,000$1,400,000Epic17$550,000$950,000Rare18$530,000$870,000Rare19$720,000$1,500,000Legendary20$450,000$780,000Rare\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: New Year Cakes from 21-30\n\n\n\n\n\nCake YearBuying From AuctionSelling As a cake collectorRarity of the Cake21$360,000$740,000Rare22$450,000$1,400,000Legendary23$320,000$720,000Rare24$290,000$680,000Rare25$270,000$660,000Rare26$260,000$640,000Rare27$420,000$2,300,000Legendary28$250,000$600,000Rare29$240,000$580,000Rare30$240,000$550,000Common\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: New Year Cakes from 31-40\n\n\n\n\n\nCake YearBuying From AuctionSelling As a cake collectorRarity of the Cake31$220,000$540,000Common32$200,000$530,000Common33$190,000$520,000Common34$400,000$780,000Epic35$400,000$760,000Epic36$170,000$510,000Common37$170,000$500,000Common38$160,000$490,000Epic39$160,000$480,000Epic40$150,000$470,000Rare\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: New Year Cakes from 41-50\n\n\n\n\n\nCake YearBuying From AuctionSelling As a cake collectorRarity of the Cake41$150,000$460,000Rare42$150,000$450,000Rare43$150,000$440,000Rare44$150,000$430,000Rare45$450,000$1,400,000Legendary46$450,000$1,400,000Legendary47$120,000$420,000Common48$120,000$400,000Common49$120,000$400,000Common50$110,000$380,000Common\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: New Year Cakes from 51-60\n\n\n\n\n\nCake YearBuying From AuctionSelling As a cake collectorRarity of the Cake51$110,000$380,000Common52$110,000$760,000Epic53$90,000$360,000Common54$90,000$360,000Common55$90,000$350,000Common56$70,000$340,000Common57$70,000$330,000Common58$70,000$320,000Common59$70,000$310,000Common60$70,000$300,000Common\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: New Year Cakes from 61-70\n\n\n\n\n\nCake YearBuying From AuctionSelling As a cake collectorRarity of the Cake61$60,000$290,000Common62$60,000$280,000Common63$60,000$280,000Common64$50,000$270,000Common65$50,000$270,000Common66$50,000$260,000Common67$50,000$250,000Common68$50,000$240,000Common69$520,000$1,300,000Rare70$200,000$450,000Common\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Total Price for a whole collection from auction and cake collector \n\n\n\nTotal Prices on auction for a whole collection= 29.17 Million\n\n1-10=12.9 Million\n11-20=6.71 Million\n21-30=3.39 Million\n31-40=2.21 Million\n41-50=1.97 Million\n51-60= 840k\n61-70= 1.150 Million\n\n\nTotal Prices on Cake Collector Auction for whole Collection= 61.51 Million\n\n1-10= 23.4 Million\n11-20=12.2 Million\n21-30=7.19 Million\n31-40=5.58 Million\n41-50=6.18 Million\n51-60=3.42 Million\n61-70=3.54 Million\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total cost of buying from auction is 29 Million compared to buying from a cake collector that is 61 Million.

This emerging market has attracted many players to buy and sell different New Year Cakes. Interestingly, there has been a trend in increasing prices since the first ten cakes were released. For example, the beginning prices were around 10k and then increased from 10k to 50k due to the new cake bag release. These cakes at 50k created a stable market with little fluctuation unless it was below New Year 20. Furthermore, this trend has increased dramatically starting from years 68-70 with the cakes going to 550k or with cake 70 at 200k. If this trend continues, the producers in the market will benefit tremendously as their cakes increase, but consumers will lose out because they will have to pay more. In other words, hypixel players will have to buy more expensive cakes and the people that sell them earn a lot more money. I estimate that New Year Cake 71 will be worth 150k-300k and the New Year Cake Market will increase in price for the next 10 skyblock years to year 80.\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nWhy do Cake Collectors charge so much?\n\nCake collectors charge a lot because we normally wait 1-2 weeks just to find specific cakes. However, people do have a valid point that we charge more than normal. There are only around 6 main competitors in the cake market, which allows cake collectors to charge more compared to the lower amount. For example, the average cake on auction can go for a minimum of 250k in bin auction. This means that cake collectors should not sell under 250k to an individual as that is how much you can get on auction.\n\nShould I get into the New Year Cake Market?\n\nThe New Year Cake Market is very profitable by buying and reselling cakes. However, there is a large time commitment to the auction every day, the cake average can jump from 50k to 90k at any time, and as they always say \u201cYou have to have money to make money.\u201d Many cake collectors spend an average of around 15 million every skyblock year on cakes and resell them later on for triple or quadruple the price. If you have the passion and the time, it is the right decision. If you don't like waiting at auction all the time and would rather be doing other money methods, than it is not the right decision\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPass on what you have learned.\u201d - Yoda"

    "body": "My name is Cillian96470 and I have been collecting New Year Cakes since year 60. I am one of the last major collectors with over 9,000 cakes collected. I have worked hard every new year to get New Year Cakes in order to help players like yourself to gain cakes either on auction or bins. I am leaving the market soon and will not be selling any more cakes. This would be your last chance to buy cakes for your cake bag or just for your collection. As time goes on in hypixel, the New Year Cakes become more expensive and this would be your last chance to get them for the current price in Hypixel Skyblock.\n\nThe reason why this is important is because I am offering discounts of around 20k and give discounts on large quantities of cakes. For example, in my shop you can get around a 1 million discount if you buy many cakes at one time. This shop that I offer will help you gain exactly what you need for cake years at a lower price compared to on the bins of auction.\n\nHistory of New Year Cakes:\n\nI remember a long time ago, when the legendary Cake collector himself \u201cSlada\u201d with over 24,100 cakes collected left the market forever and would not be selling anymore cakes. But before Slada left, he had a major sell of cakes that helped many players get full cake bags. Back then, the cake prices weren't as high as they are now. That is why I am doing this major sell before I leave the market.\n\nThere is now a large community of small, medium and major cake collectors that help each other determine prices and rarities of cakes. This community has been involved in every year since year 70 and have worked together to provide ideas and suggestions to improve cake collecting. This community has now developed overtime strategies, alliances, competitors, trading cakes, articles and more.\n\n\nCredibility:\n\nAdministrator of the Cake discord\n\nFacilitated events for the cake discord on buying certain cakes from the auction\nEncouraged community involvement in strategies, articles, and ideas\nManaging interviews with new players joining the cake community\nPlan and executed cake strategies with the cake community\nManager of Cake Shop\n\nSold 800 New Year Cakes on auction or bins\nProvided Cake Customers with the lowest prices on Bins\nOrganized New Year Cakes in a professional manner on my island\nI have had around 250-300 customers visit my island to buy cakes\n\nImportant Points on Prices:\n\nI sell below the bin price on any year cake, but higher than auction price\nGenerally rule among cake collectors, any cake below year 55 is 550k or higher\nThe bin price is typically 2 times as much as the auction price. For example, if a cake goes on auction for 100k, on bin it's 200k\nRarity cakes such as Rares, Epics, and Legendaries will be a lot more money than normal prices\n\nOctober 10th, 2020 prices\n\nMy prices are normally the Bin prices. I generally do a 20k discount depending on the year that you want.

My prediction is that the prices won't rise that much in the future, because only one cake bag works in your accessory bag (holds 54 cakes) and there will be less and less players who want to buy them as more cakes will be released in the future. This may even devalue the oldest cakes (players want the cheapest way to get +54 HP, they don't really need them).\n\nOther thing is inflation: The value of skyblock coin halves every 3 months. You can't really compare past prices (-1 year) with current ones.\n\n\n\nName: @Allenbot\n\n\nSpoiler: Allenbot Comment\n\n\n\nComment:\nThanks for this guide really needed one!\n\n\n\nName: @Rochann\n\n\nSpoiler: Rochann Comment\n\n\n\nThis is so helpful ))\nThanks sm\n\n\n\nName: @PineappleThePig\n\n\nSpoiler: PineappleThePig Comment\n\n\n\nComment:\nThanks, this is useful\n\n\n\nName: @ValuedToaster84\n\n\nSpoiler: ValuedToaster84 Comment\n\n\n\nComment:\nVery informative post, I would make sure to keep it updated, keep up the good work and great Yoda quote lol\n\n\n\nName: @snaggyfoxy\n\n\nSpoiler: snaggyfoxy Comment\n\n\n\nComment:\nthis is very good info\n\n\n\nName: @xybonez\n\n\nSpoiler: xybonez Comment\n\n\n\nComment:\nEyy Good Job!

    "body": "I decided I wanted to calculate the highest possible scc you can get right now (with and without Marina). TL;DR: 140.4% outside of dungeons, and 239.4% inside dungeons. Please, let me know if I made any mistakes here, I'm trying to prefect it and there's a lot of nitty gritty things.\n\nOutside of Dungeons:\nGear Needed:\n-Lvl 100 Epic/ Legendary Dolphin Pet w/ Washed Up Souvenir\n-Recombed Rod of the Sea w/ Treacherous / Salty reforge, Angler 6, Expertise 10\n-Recombed Shark Armor w/ Submerged Reforge and Ultimate Legion 5 on all pieces\n-Sea Emperor Century Cake Boost\n-Spiked Bait (Opt., doesn't add to multiplicative boosts)\n\nFactors that affect SCC:\n20 - Base SCC\n29 - Shredder or Phantom Rod:\n7 - Treacherous or Salty (Recomb)\n6 - Angler 6\n6 - Expertise 10\n10 - Chimera 5 (Doesn't copy Dolphin's ability so only 10)\nOther Factors:\n15 - Lvl 100 Dolphin Pet (Epic or Legendary)\n5 - Washed Up Souvenir\n10 - Full Shark Armor\n4 - Submerged reforge on all Shark Armor Pieces\n15 - Marina's Luck of the Sea 2.0\n1 - Sea Emperor Century Cake\n6 - Spiked Bait\n1.28x - Legion 5 on all armor and 20 players within 30 blocks. Yeah, I know, but it works.\n\nWhen you calculate these up you get:\n90 - Base: w/o LOTS2.0 (Marina) or Legion\n105 - w/ LOTS2.0 (Marina), w/o Legion\n115.2 - w/o LOTS2.0 (Marina), w/ legion (and 20 players)\nAnd Finally:\n134.4 SCC w/ LOTS2.0 (Marina) AND legion (and 20 players).\nIf you add spiked bait (assuming Legion doesn't affect it which I doubt it does), that's 140.4% SCC.\n\nSeriously though, Legion just isn't worth it unless you really hate money bc there's never going to be 20 players around you. I dare somebody absolutely nothing to go for it though, if somebody hasn't already. I'm also not even bothered to calculate the cost of this.\n\nIn case you were wondering, Renowned only overtakes Submerged for armor reforge once you get 98.51 SCC without legion or armor reforges.\n\nInside of Dungeons:\nI didn't original calculate this but it was mentioned so I'll try my best even though I never play dungeons. (If I get something wrong, please correct me).\nGear needed:\n-Lvl 100 Epic/ Legendary Dolphin Pet w/ Washed Up Souvenir\n-5 Star Recombed Phantom Rod w/ Chimera 5, Treacherous / Salty Reforge, Angler 6, Expertise 10\n-5 Star Recombed Superior Dragon Armor w/ Submerged Reforge and Ultimate Legion 5 on all 4 pieces\n-Sea Emperor Century Cake Boost\n-Spiked bait (Opt., doesn't add to multiplicative boosts)\n\nFactors that affect SCC:\n20 - Base SCC\nPhantom Rod - 26 (not in dungeon):\n10 - Chimera 5 (Doesn't copy Dolphin's ability so only 10)\n7 - Treacherous or Salty (Recomb)\n6 - Angler 6\n6 - Expertise 10\nOther Factors:\n15 - Lvl 100 Dolphin Pet (Epic or Legendary)\n5 - Washed Up Souvenir\n1 - Sea Emperor Century Cake\n4 - Superior Dragon Armor w/ Submerged Reforge (not in dungeon)\n1.05x - Superior Dragon Boost\n1.056x - Legion 5 on all armor pieces (Assuming you can only have 5 people in a dungeon)\n\nNow, calculations.\nIf you have Catacombs level 50 (look this is a hypothetical), your dungeon items gain +465% stats. Combine this with 5 stars on the Superior Dragon Armor and Phatom Rod, you get a 5.15x stat multiplier on them. Stats unaffected by Dungeons are as follows: Base Chance (+20), Dolphin Pet w/ Souvenir (+20), Sea Emperor Century Cake (+1), so 41%.\n56% with Marina added,\n189.9% with Phantom Rod added,\n210.5% with Superior's Submerged Boost of 20.6 added,\n~221.02% with Superior's 5% stat boost added,\nand finally with Legion's boost (w/ 4 players) is a final SCC total of ~233.4%, which, when you add spiked bait, goes to...\n239.4% SCC!\nI am in pain."

My friends and I have been discussing this, and obviously a LVL 50 skill would be more easy on the eyes rather than a LVL 55 skill. The level cap would probably be higher with some coming updates, but this is guesswork.\n\nAlso, they're going to have to increase other skills by 5 otherwise people's ASL would be so messed up. I personally don't want to grind to foraging or fishing 55. I don't think anyone else does either.\n\nTL;DR: basically this update is targeted at endgame players.

    "title": "Should Skyblock switch to 1.16+ or Hytale?",
    "body": "This post is not biased and is made from a completely neutral standpoint.\n\nFirst of all, yes it is possible to make skyblock for 1.16.\nHow? Because this server runs on 1.7, while simulating items, behaviour and etc from 1.8.\nSo yes, it IS possible to keep the server at this version while SB would require 1.16.\n\nHowever, this would take a lot of time to make it work. So this transition should NOT happen any time soon, at least not until Skyblock gets a full release. \n\nNow let's talk about the pros and cons:\n\nPros: More items, crops, blocks, mobs, more Collections, more items that can use stuff like netherite tools to have a different texture from now used ones (useless if using texture pack).\n\nCons: 1.16 is very buggy for servers, Shields (though they can just be blacklisted and unable to be crafted), having to constantly switch versions so play other games, difficultly to make this change.\n\nThough there is another way of getting more content for Skyblock. That's right, Hytale.\n\nAlthough Hytale is a long way from us, I believe moving Skyblock to Hytale would be the best option for content and game mechanics, since devs will be able to model mobs like they want, model items the way they want, they can code behaviour for specific mobs however they want.\n\nThis option has a lot of benefits: Reduces Server load for other games, easier to add content, freedom for the devs, better online experience.\n\nIN CONCLUSION (TL;DR)\nShould SB switch to 1.16 or to Hytale?\nHytale 100%. They shouldn't waste resources on trying to switch to 1.16 because of the limitations of Minecraft, Hytale will have a lot of freedom for the devs."

Today im going to expose a edgy version of Thirtyvirus.\nToadstar. \n\nToadstar is a random blue icon that plays the skyblock and farms extreme LEMONS . You may ask me why, but its true! Lets see what yt channel is doing....\n\nAh yes. CLICKBAIT conetent, which farmed 30 thousand subscribers. If we do 30 x 2 we have 60. Then we divide it by 10 and if we add 6 to 6 then we have 66 and if we flip 6 then we have 69.\n\n69 is a number of illuminagthy so toadstar works for illuminagthy. HOLD UP ON A SECOND! \nToadstar is blue but superior is yellow, then if we combine we have green. DO you know whats green? Ah yes. THE ILLUMINATI.\n\nAnyways lets expose his sky lea moe and Geometry dash videos.\n\nCombat 43, 27.5 SA and full necro SA. BRO THAT ISNT ENDGAME START GRINDINGG YOU IDOT\nLOWER ALHC LEVEL THAN ME XDDDDD\nLevel 100 edrag with low skill avrg?????? VRY SUSPICIOUS....\n\nIf he does dung guides then why he is catacombs 25...\nNOT_WISEDRAGON IS BETTER THAN YOU CLICKBAITER\n22mil damage.\n.......... \n\nEXCUSE ME????!?!?!\n\nOkays that too much exposing on skyblock\nLets move on some geometry dash gameplay\n\nFirst of all the jawbreaker gameplay\n\n\n\n\nCan you see that?\n\nHe juts NOCLIPPED though a block. Normally you jump and die if you do that.\nCall me Krazy but thats Obviously noCLIPPED.\n\n\n\n\n\nWords cant describe what is happening now.\nALSO HIS WAVE IS ILLUMINATI.\nPlus Nice sh*t recorder. Lol who even uses bandicam these times.\n\nNext up: The Ultimate Phase 99%\n\nHold up! Why toad is raibow , its supposed to be blue Not GAE. His clickbait content even pierces though game files and its more advanced than i thought!\n\n\n\n\n\nIm going to show u some noclip parts because im out of context already\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOLD UP ON A SECOND!\nDont u see that? No? Check again!\nHe has 73% on level. If we found there 4 Noclip evidences then 73 - 4 is 69.\nMy exposing machine is literally boiling.\n\nArlight lets move on last evidence\nBloodbath 101%\n\nOmg what is this starhight fly that literally humanly impossible\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOU CANT JUMP TRIPLE SPIKES BECAUSE UR NOT MICHIGUN.

Because of this I only get 1% more farming xp and 5% more chance for 2x drops. I did some investigation, and the highest rarity hoe you can get it a recombed diamond hoe, which is only gonna be rare, unless you count reaper scythe recombed, but you can't use that as a farming hoe. This means that legit the reforge stats the admins talked about in the patch notes you can't even obtain in the game due to hoes only being rare at best rarity.  I believe this also applies to the other reforges, but to a lesser degree cuz treecap and stonks are Epic already.\n\nTL;DR Blessed reforge is a SCAM, Don't buy it, its a waste of 1m"

    "body": "Disclaimer: This is a fan story and is not an official part of any in game lore, not all things will make sense\nAlso Forum Mods, please don't move this to creative corner as barely anyone actually goes there.\nDiary of a Fisherman\nA 1,200 word story by SpyderMC\n\n\nSpoiler: Day 30\n\n\n\nDear Diary,\n\nI did some research, you can unlock Diver\u2019s Armor by crafting it with Emperor Skulls which is a rare drop from Sea Emperors. I need fishing 20 to catch sea emperors though so I\u2019m pretty far from getting it. I\u2019m currently fishing level 18.\n\nI decided to go to the hub and go fish at this big pool next to a village in a cave. Along the way, I met a peculiar looking fellow. He was covered in black rags and showed no sign of skin. He kind of scared me. In his hand was a sword that he clutched very tightly..\n\n\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d he asked. His voice was almost inaudible and every word he said shook my ears.\n\n\u201cUhhhh,\u201d I blurted out scrambling to find words to say, \u201cWhat\u2019s that sword?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an Aspect of the End, it allows me to teleport.\u201d\n\n\u201cTele whaaaa?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cTeleport, it means I can transport myself anywhere I would like to without having to manually walk or move there. Sadly, this Aspect of the End only allows me to teleport 8 blocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d I said, completely stunned. Teleporting. Huh, I mouthed it a few more times. It felt weird to say that.\n\u201cAnyway, what\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked him.\n\n\u201cThey call me JC,\u201d he said, careful not to show his mouth or any emotion.\n\n\u201cCool, how do you-\u201d I was midway through my sentence when he teleported away with his Aspect of the End.\n\nThat guy sure was full of secrets, I thought to myself. I wondered if I could get my hands on an Aspect of the End.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Day 31\n\n\n\nDear Diary,\n\nMy encounter with JC still felt like a minute ago. He was so, what was the word, mysterious and secretive. What was he hiding under his rags? Creepy.\n\nI met up with JC again today. This time, instead of holding an Aspect of the End or as he called it, an AOTE, he was holding a fishing rod. It didn\u2019t look like he was going fishing so I was confused.\n\n\u201cWhy are you holding a fishing rod?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just any fishing rod, it\u2019s a grappling hook,\u201d he said, shaking his head.\n\n\u201cOh, what does it do?\u201d\n\nInstead of talking to me, he flung the \u201cGrappling Hook\u201d out and when it went the max distance, he pulled it back and flung himself into the air flying away leaving me behind with my mouth hanging and eyes as big as plates.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Day 32\n\n\n\nDear Diary,\n\nToday I hung out in the hub for a while when I encountered for the 5th time, someone wearing dragon armor. The player was wearing red and orange armor and was wearing a black leather helmet also.\n\n\u201cHi there! Can I ask you a few questions?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want, I have other things to get to,\u201d said the player impatiently.\n\nI saw him grip his sword tighter. I shivered, nervous to not make a wrong move.\n\n\u201cWhat items should I get next, Diver\u2019s Armor or a Rod of Champions?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell from what I\u2019ve heard, the Sea Emperor drops both enchanted lily pads and Emperor Skulls, which you need to craft both of them, I suggest you try to catch a Sea Emperor and see where it gets you,\u201d responded the player.\n\n\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s your name? I might catch you some time later,\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Justalie12 but you can just call me Justalie,\u201d he said, \u201cAnyway, I gotta go follow, err, lead someone home.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, he was gone.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Day 33\n\n\n\nDear Diary,\n\nI\u2019m now fishing 19, only a few more days till I\u2019m fishing 20!! I can\u2019t wait to catch an Emperor. I might go fishing and see if there are any new creatures I can catch.\n\nOMG GUESS WHAT! I caught this creature called a Water Hydra and it dropped it\u2019s head! Isn\u2019t that cool? The head gives 100 health and 100 defense. I\u2019m so excited! Fishing makes so much money it\u2019s insane. I\u2019m not sure what to put today, nothing really exciting has happened\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Day 34\n\n\n\nDear Diary,\n\nToday I got fishing 20! While I was fishing, some guy started slow clapping. I asked him what it was and he said this.\n\n\u201cSeriously man? You\u2019re fishing but you're not using any bait at all. Here, take some of my spiked bait. You\u2019ll catch a ton more creatures.\u201d\n\nHe then reached into his inventory and handed me a purple looking spiked thing. I put the purple thing and put it in my inventory. I then flung out my fishing rod and saw the purple thing drop out of my inventory. I pulled back my fishing rod and went to go grab my \u201cbait\u201d. However when I dove out to it, I didn\u2019t pick it up.\n\nThe player started to chuckle. I felt my cheeks glow bright red.\n\n\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d I demanded, my cheeks were burning now.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to pick them up, the bait disappears when you fish with it. The bait dropping is just cosmetic and it doesn't actually drop.\u201d\n\nOk, now I wasn\u2019t just embarrassed. I was mad, mad at myself. I felt the rest of my face glow red and I felt my head steaming.\n\n\u201cWhoa there man, you need to chill, I know how I can help, I know a yoga class that will help you,\u201d said the player.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Day 35\n\n\n\nDear Diary,\n\nToday I went fishing again. I caught up a few sea creatures and got a few rare drops. After a while, I finally caught an Emperor. When the emperor came up, I grabbed my blade and started stabbing the guardian.\n\nThe Emperor shot me with an arrow and it flung me backwards. As I staggered back to kill the Emperor, another player in Diver\u2019s Armor sped over to the mob wielding an emerald. He jumped up and killed the Emperor in one hit. I hobbled over and yelled at the player.\n\n\u201cHEY! Gimme the drops, that was my Emperor!\u201d\n\nThe player ignored me and picked up the drops. He then used his AOTE and teleported away into the hub. I tried to run after him but he was too fast.\n\nI fell down onto my knees and started crying. Why did everything good that happened to me turn bad? That was my one chance at getting an Emperor.\n\nWho was the person that stole my sea creature? I needed to find him.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Day 36\n\n\n\nDear Diary,\n\nMy life has so many mysteries. First there\u2019s a bunch of random writing in my diary, then a mysterious being punches me in the face, then I meet JC, then Justalie12, then someone steals my Emperor. It\u2019s like before I got my diary, everything was boring and then when I got my diary, everything started to get interesting.\n\nI also got fishing 21 today. From my research, there aren't any new mobs that I can fish up. I\u2019m gonna go fish some more and see what I can get. \n\nWell, I caught a Deep Sea Protector today. I was doing well in the first half. I circled around it hitting it up and down. Then, the golem swung it\u2019s fists at me and knocked me off my feet. Then the player who stole my Emperor came back and killed the golem within a matter of seconds and ran off again with it\u2019s drops.\n\nGrrr, this was like the mysterious writing in my diary again! Somebody does something to me and it keeps on repeating.\n\n\n\nTo be continued...\n\n\n\ntl;dr: no\n\nHi guys! Spyder here, really really really sorry for releasing part 4 so late. It was kind of hard coming up with ideas to put in part 4. If you couldn't tell, JC was @JavaChipYT and Justalie was @Juse73X . If you want to be in part 5, start a convo with me following the same format as last time.\n\nMake sure to check out parts 1-3!\u200b"

Ex. you chose 5 t4 revs. when you kill a t4 rev, it will auto start a new one until you have completed your 5th one.\n(Any thoughts please comment them)\n\n\nPlease Bump and Like (Price of item can fluctuate; If I can find more perks to add I will keep the price, If not I will decrease it.)\n\nAny tips on what the pricing of item should be I was thinking a couple Million Coins.

Minigames will be scored With a 300 point system. The scores are: C 110 points or less. B 140 points or less B+ 160 points or less A 200 points or less A+ 230 points or less S 260 points or less S+ 289 points or less S++ 290 points or above. Every minigame has its own scoring values.

Getting S rank or higher in 5 minigames grants 200 extra reputation. Finishing in the top 5% players in 30 minigames grants permanent +5% reputation gain. Getting A+ rank or higher in 50 minigames grants 1000 extra reputation. Getting 2 S++ ranks in one event grants 2500 extra reputation. Getting S+ in 75 or more minigames grants 5000 reputation. And finally getting 10 S++ ranks grants permanent +15% reputation gain.

Here ill show the concept of all 8 minigames (Probably Going to be expanded till 12 minigames)\n\nIt is very important to know that minigames will not include anything that isnt provided in the minigame during the minigames (Everyone has the same things like in a bedwars game for example)\n\n1. Egg Battle \n\nYour placed in a 5 layered platform with up to 29 other players. Your speed is set at regular speed and your goal is to use eggs to throw people to the void. The platforms first layer will be 16x16 the 2nd layer will be 18x18 the 3rd layer will be 20x20 the 4th layer 22x22 and the 5th layer 24x24 (All of these will be shaped circularly) These layers have a 4 block vertical distance between each other,Your given a infinite egg supply. The eggs will also have knockback I to help you melee nearby enemies. You cannot die other than by falling off the void. There will be powerups which spawn every 20s (One powerup per layer. The powerup spawns in a random place of the layer) There is 3 powerups which are: \n\nPowerup NamePowerup UsageDurationTriple EggsThe powerup as its name says makes you shoot 3 eggs at once in a 20 degree spread8 SecondsDiggerYou are given a anvil which when placed will fall destroying any block in its way making a hole for players to fallIf the anvil isnt placed within 15s it will despawnRabbit LeapsYou gain Jump boost VII Which can be usefull to get to a higher layer if you have fallen down4 Seconds\n\nAfter the 2:00 mark TNT will start falling from the top destroying blocks where it falls (All of the platforms should be destroyed at around the 7:15-8:00 mark if no block had been destroyed other than by TNT) The tnt will also knockback any nearby player. Once the 3:00 time mark is reached All players take +25% knockback from ranged egg hits and the egg becomes enchanted with knockback II for melee. Once the 5:00 time mark is reached All players get Slowness I and eggs are thrown at +50% speed. Once the 6:30 time mark is reached All players take +175% Knockback from ranged egg hits and the egg becomes enechanted with knockback IV. If the 7:15 Time mark is reached Rabbit Leaps powerup is disabled and wont spawn. (Only Digger and Quintiple Eggs) Triple Eggs turn to quintiple eggs because Triple eggs will be shot by default now. [This game focuses on using knockback to defeat enemies]\n\nScoring Of the game: Every 10s Lasted Gain +1 Score. Every player who dies before you grants +6 Score. Winning Grants +30 Score, Winning before the 5th minute grants a extra +40 Score.\n\n2. Builder Birds\n\nYou are placed in a series of small islands competing with 29 other players to build the shown structure as fast as possible. There is 40 rounds in total, And you have a 8:00 Time limit. You win by either completing all the rounds or being the one completed most buil when the time runs out. The first 5 rounds will be in a 8x8 building area and itll be around 20-35 blocks. Rounds 6-10 will be in a 10x10 building area and the build will be around 30-40 blocks Including trickier blocks like slabs/stairs. Rounds 11-20 will be in a 14x14 building area with a around 50-80 blocks count including very tricky objects as buttons tripwire hooks levers pressure plates cobwebs and even string. Rounds 21-30 will be in a 16x16 building area with a very high 75-100 block count and very complex builds including any item you can think of. Rounds 31-35 will be in a 18x18 building area at 95-115 blocks each featuring builds which require great skill to build fast. And the final rounds 36-40 will be in a 20x20 building area at 120-150 blocks possibly including a full inventory of blocks needed. Between Each island there will be a gap which you will have to bridge trough (Your given infinite redstone blocks to pass) The gap is adding 2 blocks per round starting at 10 at round 1. But you must be carefull when bridging Not to let your redstone bridge touch the TNT that will be spread around in the air (Around 20-200 TNT per gap) or else your bridge will be destroyed and youd have to start remaking it. In these gaps you may also see gold blocks in the air (1-5 per gap 10 at last round) These are gotten by the same was as youd blow up TNT, These gold blocks dont do anything normally but incase theres a tie in rounds by the amount of gold blocks gotten the winner will be decided. [This game focuses on rapid building/speedbridging]\n\nScoring Of the game: Every build completed grants +6 score. Winning grants +60 Score.\n\n3. Pearl Race\n\nYour placed in a massive map where you race 29 other players to get as far as you can in the pearl race. You Cant move at all other than by ender pearls Your supplied infinite pearls (4s Cooldown) You have 8 minutes for the race. The race begins with easy hits like 4x4 platforms with a 3 block wall to avoid dying. After that you might start mainly seeing 2x2 or 3x1 platforms. There may even be places where you have to go trough a hole in the wall to get to your location. Later on paintings and 1x1 platforms will be the main thing. Once your getting closer to the end of the race your gonna see lots of random walls of iron bars 1x1 from floor-roof that your gonna have to avoid and probably your gonna have to land on single fences/cobblestone walls at the very ending parts its gonna be a really tight place featuring extremely hard to get locations. The whole path is about 1000 Blocks Taking 4 turns to the right all 4 of em or to the left all 4 of em (You know where im going dont you) Once you pass the ending part youll find yourself back at the beginning in a \"new lap\". There will be Checkpoints every 80 blocks or so that will be marked by a particle wall, youll spawn in the checkpoints if you have failed a epearl jump. Theres no ender-pearl damage in the minigame. The Winner is decided by who got furthest into the race. By either the furthest checkpoint in the lap that they got to. (Tiebreaker would be at what time did they reach the checkpoint which they ended on) or by the exact furthest block counting laps that they ever got to. (Tiebreaker (Very rarely) would be what time did they reach that block peak). [This game focuses on precision epearl throws and its a fun og minigame from 2013 too!]\n\nScoring Of the game: For every player you beat get +8 Score. Winning grants +68 Score.\n\n4. Battle Birds\n\nYour placed in a map of nearly the same style as TNT Tag with 29 other players. The goal is to be the last one alive. Your set at 110 speed. The map will give you 3os to get as high as you can (About 40 blocks from ground level should be the highest possible) Before a border starts slowly rising (Lava or whatever u want as long as it kills u) Which will completely cover the map in around the time mark of 7:00. Your given a Knockback I stick but you have a 2s cooldown per hit, You get a punch I bow with 4 arrow shots, Use it wisely as you wont get more shots ever. After the 4:00 mark Stick cooldown is entirely taken off and it gets Knockback III instead. Player speed is naturally 125 now but if your hit by a stick its at 25 for 1s. After the 6:00 mark staying in the same spot for 3s starts damaging you. 1 Heart a second (Only way to take dmg other than falling down) But you will never regenerate hp, You will also be forced to hit a player every 10s at least to avoid taking 1 heart a second dmg Once your at the 6:45 mark you get knockback VII on your sticks (basically to kill everyone) And if you dont hit within 2s you take 6 Hearts a second. Incase 2 players die at the same time they will be tiebreaked by the amount of hp they had before dying. [This game focuses to be some pvp/parkour mix type of minigame]\n\nScoring Of the game: For every player that dies before you, Gain +8 Score. Winning grants +68 Score.\n\n5. Bird Spleef\n\nYour placed in a map of 3 layers with 29 other players. The goal is to be the last one alive. Your set at 165 speed but You can only Jump every 7 seconds. Everyone has the same setup which is the following one:\n\nItem:Use of the ItemMini Pearl x1.Its a enderpearl, But can only be thrown at a 4 block range Attempting to throw it at a longer range will give the pearl back to you saying that the range is too long. This can help go trough a gap if you dont have a jump and need to get away fast.Iron ShovelYou probably guessed it. Its to break the snow blocks your standing on.Speed II Potion (7 seconds) x2A useful speed boost to chase someone or get away from someone, Be aware that your slower while drinking the potion.Splash Potion Of Mining Fatigue IV (13 seconds) x1Gives you a bit of time where the person who is chasing you cant break blocks allowing you to escape/go aggresive on them. Beware of splashing yourself though.Fishing Rod Knockback I (5s Cooldown)You can throw it on someone to hit them and pulling the rod back will drag them 1.25 blocks towards you potentially pushing them to a hole but you need to pull within 2s of hitting em or the hook despawns and you have to wait again. You could also use this as a melee hit with knockback I. Both of these need a 5s cooldown after each use.\n\nThe layers are each 32x32 size and a 11 block vertical gap between each other. In the middle of each layer theres a 6x6 Netherrack platform in the center. (You can break it but it takes a while since its not a shoveled thing) The point of the one in the middle is that its unreachable with a pearl since its a 5 block distance between each layer. The layers have a circled shape. After the 2:00 time mark Speed is set to 135 and all shovels gain efficiency V. After the 4:30 time mark fishing rod cooldown is deleted and you get 1 snowball every 3 seconds (up to 5) to shoot at enemies. After the 6:50 time mark the first layer vanishes entirely and Speed is reduced to 100 + Jumpings entirely disabled. After 7:15 time mark the second layer vanishes entirely and speed is reduced to 70. And the final layer will slowly degrade by the edges. At around 7:30 it should be at a 6x6 size the final layer. Here your fishing rod gets knockback V. and infinite snowballs which deal 1 block kb on hit are given. at 7:45 everyones given a diamond sword sharp X and pvp damage is enabled (basically a one hit kill). [This minigame focuses on spleef and to stay away from players using surroundings for your advantage]\n\nScoring Of the game: For every player that dies before you, Gain +8 Score. Winning Grants +68 Score.\n\n6. Flying Snek\n\nYour placed in a map of 64x64x64 Blocks with 29 other players. The goal is to be the last one alive. You are a snek (Snake) of 4 block size. Movement is pretty simple. -> to go right <- to go left ^ to go up v to go down. Your snek expands 1 block every 0.5 seconds. (There is no way to get rid of the blocks, Your snake moves at the same speed it expands) Additionally the ground is made of Beacons (4096 beacons in total because of the ground size) Every 25 seconds 512 beacons (1/8 of the beacons) get a White light that marks that the beacons light will become Red in 4 seconds. (Red beacon light lasts for 3 seconds) If your sneks head touches a Red beacon light. Your snek dies. Hitting another sneks body with your sneks head= your snek dies. If a head of a snek hits another head of a snek If only the snek that hit was pointing at the other sneks head. Then the one that hit dies. If both sneks were pointing at each others head. Both sneks die. If your snek hits a map edge (They are marked by Solid blocks) The snek dies. After the time mark of 1:30 Snek expansion becomes 1 block every 0.35 seconds. After the time mark of 2:30 Snek expansion becomes 1 block every 0.25 seconds. After the time mark of 4:00 The Map begins to shrink from the top and the bottom each of them shrinking 16 blocks (At 4:30 the 16 blocks should be shrinked on each side turning the map 64x64x32) After the time mark of 5:30 The map will shrink again from the top and bottom each of them shrinking 15 blocks (At 6:00 the 15 blocks should be shrinked on each side making the map 64x64x2) At 7:00 The map will shrink from all sides (North South East West) 32 Blocks. (At 8:00 the map should be 0x0x2 basically = game end) [This minigame focuses on planning ahead how are you going to manage your sneks posicion and being careful of the beacons that might ruin your perfect spiral plan]\n\nScoring Of the game: For every player that dies before you, Gain +8 Score. Winning Grants +60 Score.\n\n7. Egg Shooter\n\nYour placed in a map of 50x50 Blocks with 29 other players. The goal is to get as many kills as possible, Your speed is set to normal (100).

If the top player has 3x more kills than you or more., Any kill you get counts as 2 This lasts until the top player no longer has 3x more kills than you or more.

If they have the same score and deaths there will be a 30 second period that will decide the winner by the first of the 2 To get a kill will win. Or the first which dies of the 2 will not win. [This minigame focuses on good aim and to be carefull not to get shot by enemies]\n\nScoring Of the game: For every player that you beat get +8 Score. Winning grants +68 Score.\n\n8.

Right now the item is on the ground for 5 seconds and then other players can pick up the item. Instead of that, I think the item should automatically go into your stash to stop people from taking your overflux, baby yeti, and other rare drops because you were pinned in a corner by wolves or a very annoying snowman.

If you could do you mind checking some of it and answering some of my questions? Thanks!  \n\nAlso, if you're not sure how I got some of the numbers check down at the bottom under the heading 'How I got the figures'.\n\nIf you have any questions reply to the thread and I will respond soon.\n\nChance for me to get Tara Talisman and Tara Pet\n\n\nDrop chance for me to get the Tarantula Talisman\n\n1/{(Approximate drop chance) / Magic find - amount of bosses I killed}\n\n1/{(1999/3.23) / 2.17 - 9} =\n\n1/276.200667703 (no1)\n\n\nDrop chance for me to get the Tarantula Pet\n\n1/{Approximate drop chance / MF - amount of spiders I have killed}\n\n1/{12000 / 2.17 - 3211} =\n\n2318.953917050691 (no2)\n\n\nTotal chance to get both drops (They were not acquired from the same mob)\n\n=1/{(no1) x (no2)}\n\n=1/640496.620262\n\n= 0.00000156128%\n\n\nI have probably calculated this wrong idk\n\n\nHow I got the figures\n\n\nI calculated the approximate drop chance from refraction\u2019s skycrypt it said he has killed 2053 tara brood fathers killed. Then from 2053 you need to take away 54 because that is the amount that he would have had to kill to get to tara 6 meaning he has had 1999 tara broodfather 4\u2019s that he had a chance to get the talisman from. 1999/3.23 gives approximate drop chance as it says on skycrypt he would\u2019ve according to theoretical probability acquired 3.23 tara talismans with 0 MF.\n\nThen divide this by 2.17 because I have 117% Magic Find and minus 9 because I have killed 9 tara bosses since I hat tara 6.\n\nTara pet drop chance is estimated to be 1/12000 from spiders at the spiders den (unconfirmed). Divide this by the amount of MF I have and minus the amount of spiders I have killed and you get yourself the next figure.\n\nMultiply the chances because that is the chance of me getting both of these.\n\nP.S.\n\n\nBtw I killed the T4 tara boss then freaked out at the talisman and was being hit by spiders I killed three and on the third kill got the pet. Would this have any effect on the chance because I got them so close together? I don\u2019t think so but please let me know\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to I go by lots of names\u2019 video: Cookie no rookie got an epic and a leg e drag back to back which supposedly has a 0.00008% chance of happening but I think this was calculated incorrectly because then I would be the luckiest man in skyblock and also E-drag pets are definitely rarer than what I got."

I would roughly estimate ~160million lost from being hacked. What is lucky is that I joined half way when the hacker had put stuff onto my auctionhouse. A lot of my things were lowballed, although it was not by the hacker's alt. I believe that auctionhouse flippers flipped my items. Half of my stuff was taken from the hacker and I even lost some of the one time talismans: hat accessory and potato talisman. I would like advice on what to do. Either quit, main fishing, sweat dungeons (dont really want to) or take a big break and just place snow minions.\n\n\n\nF in the chats, https://hypixel.net/threads/the-story-of-how-i-lost-600mil.3227733/#post-22570491"

    "title": "Armor Tier List",
    "body": "A\n\nPerfect Armor Tier X (1200 def) - Arguably the best armor in Skyblock. I mean with 1200 defense, you become nearly invincible. It is 3 times better than the Hardened Diamond Armor and provides 2 times the defense of Dragon Armor. Although this Armor has no abilities, it's insane amount of defense makes up for it.\n\nWise Dragon Armor ( 500 def, 350 hp ) - For me this is the best Dragon set. All abilities cost 50% less mana. You can basically become unkillable if you have a Zombie Sword with you. Rogue Sword and AOTE is also very fun and useful while wearing this armor.\n\nSuperior Dragon Armor ( 600 def, 450 hp ) - This armor boosts all your stats by five percent. AOTD ability also deals 50 percent more damage which means that it's ability will now do more than a thousand damage. For me this is the 2nd best Dragon set.\n\n\nStrong Dragon Armor ( 500 def, 350 hp) - With this full set on you gain 100 more strength, which increases your base damage by a lot. This set also buffs AOTE by a little. If you want to deal lots of damage, then use this set.\n\nUnstable Dragon Armor ( 500 def, 350 hp) - Increase your crit chance and damage by a ton, which is very good because you have a better chance to one or two shot Zealots and other End mobs. The lighting ability is also pretty decent too.\n\nProtector Dragon Armor ( 500 def, 350 hp) - This set is focused on defense. It also increases your defense when you are low which is really good. The lower you are the more defense you get.\n\nOld Dragon Armor ( 520 def, 650 hp ) - This set has no cool abilities, but it gives a lot of health and defense which is really awesome. It is not that great compared to other Dragon sets but I still think this set is an A tier.\n\nEmerald Armor ( 570 def, 300 hp ) - This used to be the best armor in the game, but now it is outclassed by Perfect Armor and Dragon Armor. It is still a pretty decent End game Armor though.\n\nDiver Armor( 500 def, 290 hp) - Super rare to get because you need to fish a LOT, which takes a crap ton of patience but it has really good stats. When you swim underwater you become aquaman. However, it is still outclassed by other end game armours.\n\nBlaze Armour( 410 def ) - An amazing armour. The recent update removes fire prot from the Armour which means that you can now put prot on it. With the full set on you gain 40 strength, 8 percent speed and immunity to fire and lava. Mobs will also take damage when you are near them. This armour is about as expensive as Speedster Armour but I think it's worth it.\n\n\nB\n\nEnder Armour( 170 def, 90 hp ) - This armour is only good in the end as it doubles all stats, including reforges. It is a pain to get this armour though, as Enderman rarely drop these. Outside of the end it is pretty useless.\n\nYoung Dragon Armor( 500 def, 350 hp) - Worst Dragon set. It is basically like speedster armor but with more health and defense. You gain 70% WALK speed when only you are at FULL health. You can just use rogue sword and it will still be faster. This is a good set but it is the worst Dragon set.\n\nSpeedster Armour (350 def) - It is like hardened diamond armor but with 20 more defense and a lot more speed. It is a very good mid game Armor and not that hard to get. Just build a huge sugar cane farm and you will be surprised how easy it is to get that armour.\n\nMonster Hunter( 235 def, 220 hp) - It has pretty decent defense and hp, but what makes this armour so good is the fact that there are four abilities in this armour. You also deal 25% more damage to mobs and take less damage from mobs. Pretty good mid game Armor.\n\nHardened Diamond( 330 def) - This is one of the best early to mid game armours. It provides good defense which is good as you will now not get one or two shotted by the obsidian sanctuary mobs. It is also very easy to get and craft.\n\nGolem Armour (250 def, 105 hp ) - This is a good early game armour, but I still think it's not worth the time to get this armor as it so expensive. It's stats is equally matched to Hardened Diamond so I recommend going for Hardened Diamond as it is much easier.\n\nSponge Armour( 285 def) - Relatively easy to craft, it has high defense and when in water, the defense is that of an Emerald Armour! Although on land it is outclassed by many mid game armours.\n\nZombie Armour( 60 def, 530 hp) - Similar to the Magma Armour, it has low def and high hp. But what makes this armour B tier is that you regenerate health two times faster and also regenerate health when hit by a projectile. However this armour is SUPER expensive to craft.\n\nC\n\nEmber Armour( 180 def, 200 hp ) - Honestly this armour is not that good. It provides less defense than golem and Hardened Diamond. The full set ability is also not that good. You could just use fire or lava talisman instead. \n\nMagma Armour( 85 def, 470 hp ) - This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think Magma Armour is not that good. Sure it has super high health and intelligence but look at its defense..... ITS ABYSMAL. If you go to the end with this armour you would probably get one or two shotted. Heck, you would probably have a hard time against the Obsidian Sanctuary mobs.\n\nMiner Armour( 375 def in mines ) - In mines it is very good and it's regen ability is super broken, but outside of the mines it is probably one of the worst Armour in Skyblock.\n\nArmour of Growth( 145 def, 380 hp) - Pretty decent def and hp. This armour also has good healing abilities as well. But you need to get like 5000000000 dark oak wood....... so it's not worth it for me.\n\nLapis Armour( 120 def, 60 hp) - Great set for early game. It gives 200% more experience when mining ores which is very useful. However it's stats are low so you would probably get two shotted by the Obsidian Sanctuary mobs.\n\nMiner's Outfit ( 100 def ) - Absolutely must have when you are trying to grind cobblestone as it gives haste two which will insta break it. Not useful in combat.\n\n\nD\n\nCrystal Armour (100 def ) - The base defense is trash, even worse than Lapis Armor. You also need to rely on the freaking light level in order to make it slightly better. This armour is a complete joke.\n\nAngler Armour( 80 def, 165 hp ) - This is mainly used for fishing but....... with that defense you would get bodied by sea monsters. It did not even show statistics it just says it increases the spawn rate of sea creatures and reduces damage, but how much? If you want to increase sea creatures spawn rate then there are billions of ways you can do it in skyblock. \n\nDiamond Armour( 100 def ) - With that Armour set on you would absolutely get destroyed by even lapis zombies. It is a good starter Armour though because you can wear it and grind lapis zombies until you get lapis Armour.\n\nFairy Armour( 4 def, 4 hp ) - Sure you get speed but...... the defense is in the same level as leather Armour. Also you get -4 intelligence. Brilliant."

    "body": "Disclaimer - I have also posted this thread in the ideas and feedback forum to reach more people. \nThis can be viewed at https://hypixel.net/threads/idea-stereo-talisman.3032711/\n\nI don't usually make threads but a very random idea popped into my head and I want to receive people's feedback on it. \n\nWhat I impose is a stereo talisman which could be crafted from the prismarine shard collection.\nSimilar to the cake bag it would grant you a stat boost depending on how many unique music discs you have stored away in it. (Potentially Intelligence)\n\nYou can also have the option to play these discs, of course they will have to only play for you otherwise the lobbies would have 50 different music tracks going off at once.\n\nWith the use of prismarine shards it will give life to the primarine shard collection and cause more people to want to fish. It will also give people the incentive to collect all the discs for a small intelligence reward.\n\nThe talisman could have craftable upgrades which will enable more discs to be stored in it at once.\n\nThe Stereo Talisman can store up to 7 music discs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe talisman would crafted using 2 stacks of enchanted redstone dust, 1 stack of enchanted prismarine shards and one jukebox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stereo Ring is upgraded from the Stereo Talisman and can store 14 unique discs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ring would be crafted using 4 stacks of enchanted redstone dust, 2 stacks of enchanted prismarine shards and 1 Stereo Talisman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally the Stereo Artifact is upgraded from the stereo ring and is able to hold 21 unique music discs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the final version of this item it will be crafted using 4 enchanted redstone blocks, 4 stacks of enchanted prismarine shards and 1 Stereo Ring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuplicate Discs\nOne key thing to note is that players will most likely fish multiple of the same disc during their hunt for all the unique ones.\nSo I impose at the bottom of the interface for the stereo there is an option to cast away duplicate music discs which are already registered in the stereo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be a stat boost reward for every certain amount of duplicate music discs deposited into the hopper. There could be a feature for you to enable the discs to automatically go into the talisman as well, acting like a sack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me know what you all think."

    "body": "Well, we all know about the portal in the wizards tower.\nBut once you try to go inside it... it doesnt send you somewhere.\nTime to work on the wizard portal!!!!!!!!!! save me.\nSo first, lets talk about where it will send you. You will be at y200. Every block is random. It isnt clean. You find a NPC. Their name? Their name is ???\nTry talking with them and this will happen.\n\n\nSpoiler: NPC: ???\n\n\n\n???: Who are you? \n???: Why are you?\n???: Who are you?\n???: Why are you.\n???: Who. Are. You.\nNow this island is meant for early late game players. Not 1983b network **** but like 50 mil midas sup armor, the stereotype.\nNow this person goes after you, they arent slow but they sure aint fast. They are using running speed. Their AI uses the same AI a hacked client would use for the hack \u00a8hunt\u00a8. It just goes after all targets, but hypixel would make it so it just targets you.\nHis hits are no joke, doing half of your health bar. But, there is a catch. He stops going after you if you are 50 blocks away. Bow shots dont work vs ??? and you can only heal. Once you kill him he drops a book and quill. You cant read it.\n\n\n(These mobs will have no HP value. You just need to hit them a current amount.)\nYou move on. 1000 blocks foward. You see a second NPC. Their name is !!! Try talking with them and this will happen.\n\n\nSpoiler: NPC: !!!\n\n\n\n!!!: Why did you do this!\n!!!: Why did you do this!\n!!!: Why did you do this.\n!!!: Why. Did. You.\nThis person deals 1/3 of your HP with one hit, and cant be damaged by a sword. You need to bow them. This persons speed is not a joke either. Well it is speed? Every 2.5 seconds it teleports to you and trys to hit you. But somehow, you kill them. They drop a ink sack. You cant craft it into anything.\n\n\nYou move on. But you hear the sound of a mad endermen.\nYou look behind you yet nothing. Move on. \nYou hear it again. Are you going mad? No, this cant be the case.\n???: Why hello.\n!!!: How are you.\nWithin the blink of an eye they show up as a red eyed endermen. You keep walking. You see the wizard but in a ruined state. Try to talk to him and...\n\n\nSpoiler: NPC: Wizard \n\n\n\nWizard: Help me, they are after us. Please take me with you. Please. Please\nWizard: You will! Thank you.\nWizard: (the glitch minecraft text)\nYou are now in a remade version of the end. He just tells you,\nWizard: Run.\nThe NPCS: ??? and !!! Go after you, in slow speed. But sometimes teleport to you.\nOnce you are within 100 blocks of the weirdos you get a 3rd npc. Once this NPC talks the wizard is gone.\nWiz??!: Help. \nWiz??!: Help.\nWi?!?!: HelppP!P\nW?!?!: HE!W\n?!?!?!: Hello.\nThis npc now fights you. Only dealing 1/5 of your HP bar. But still hard to kill. This NPC has the same factors of ???.\nOnce defeating this npc you are granted with a new item.\nA piece of paper. It reads: Combine the relems, combine the items.\n\n\nIf you put all of these items you granted into a crafting table, you will get a readable book.\nFor what is inside it, it is up to you. New lore for yall to figure out.\n\n\nSpoiler: The drops of the bosses\n\n\n\n??? Would drop 30 enchanted sugar cane.\n!!! Would drop 100 enchanted eyes of ender\n?!?!?! Would drop 53 enchanted paper.\n\n\nAnd that is it!\n@TheEnderMan250 (They reminded me about the wizards portal)"

  {
    "title": "The Ultimate Skyblock Guide - Noob To Pro - Work In Progress.",
    "body": "Hey Guys,\nI am making this guide to help players become good in Skyblock. I will be using NPC sell price for materials although it is recommended that players sell Materials to the Bazaar for extra coins.\n\nStep 1: Starting A New Profile.\nThe First Step to Beating SkyBlock is Starting a New Profile. The Profile Must be Apple. Apples are associated with Good Luck & Money. Everything we want in this profile.\n\nStep 2: The First Hour.\nStart your new profile by breaking the tree and bridging to the hub portal. (If one of the leaves drops an apple keep it, and place it in a chest, You need the luck) You will start by talking to each of the villagers. By doing this you will receive your first 170 coins. With your free money Find the farm merchant who will sell you a rookie hoe for extremely cheap. Purchase the hoe and start punching away at the wheat until you unlock the recipe for Harvesting 5. Run back to the farm merchant and purchase some sugar cane to craft into paper then harvesting 5. You will then move to the blacksmith to put the enchant on. Once you have harvesting, walk to the witch's hut and mine all the nether wart. You will need to mine this until you get the potion affinity talisman recipe. Craft this as-well as a farming talisman. *WARNING* do not sell the excess wheat/seeds to the merchant. You will then make your way to the forest. Speak to the Lumber Merchant and complete his quest. He will reward you with an axe, which you will use to forage up to level 7. Make your way to the Mine Merchant and purchase 3 gold. Create a Golden Pickaxe and mine up to level 1. One hitting level 1 go to the gold mine and complete the lazy miners quest. Continue to mine all 3 ores (Coal, Iron & Gold). These ores will be used to make minions later on. You Have now Unlocked the Bazaar. Selling all the materials to NPC will net you approximately 15k. You will need to deposit this into the bank IMMEDIATLY.\n\nStep 3: Gearing Up.\nWeapons & Armor are one of the most important things in SkyBlock. Your first armor set will be Pumpkin Armor. This set it commonly forgotten about, and its ability will help a lot in the early game. You will need to mine 100 pumpkins to unlock the recipe for this armor set and only require 24 to craft. You will need to save the extra pumpkins in order to create a starter pumpkin farm on your island, which you will use to increase your farming level (NOTE: This will not be your full sized farm). Once back at your island, use any blocks you have spare to make a 16x16 room with ceilings 3 blocks high, This will be used to store Minions/Mobs. Create holes in the wall so that you can hit the mobs without getting hit yourself. This will allow you to have a mob farm without wasting minion slots. For the weapon you will use a Undead Sword. You will need to create enchanted golden apples, using the apples from foraging 7 and the gold from mining 7 to make a life steal 2 book. This book will go on your sword and will help you last that little bit longer in the Deep Caverns.\n\nStep 4: Deep Caverns.\nFinally, Progression is being made. In the deep caverns you only have 1 goal, To get Ores. You will need to mine enough Coal/Iron/Gold to upgrade each minion to t5. After doing this make a hast 3 pot and mine cobblestone until you get enough to make 5-6 Compactors, these will be used in the minions. Continue exploring the deep caverns until you reach the Pigman Den. You will need to stay here for around 10mins mining Redstone until you unlock the Enchanted Redstone Collection. You will then make 5-6 Enchanted Redstone and combine that with the enchanted cobblestone to make a compactor. Place the Minions and the Compactor on your island. You can then log off knowing that your minions will be working overnight.\n\nStep 5: Minion Slots + Foraging\nPumpkin Armor with and undead sword can only last so long. Its time for an upgrade. Using ender pearls (obtained from mob box) go to the Spiders Den and slay some spiders until you unlock the spider minion recipe. Craft as many spider minions as you can (Keep in mind your Minion Slots) and place them into your mob box. Make a water system so that all the mobs get pushed to the gap where you can slay them. Kill these spiders until you can craft 3 enchanted string. This will be used to make a Savana Bow. After completed Craft a golden axe with efficiency 5 and brew some haste 3 pots. You will need to mine logs until you can upgrade each foraging minion to level 7. When doing this you will unlock all foraging collections which is needed for the next weapon, Raider Axe.\n\nStep 6: New Gear.\nAfter grinding your foraging you are in need of a new weapon. This will be the Raider Axe. To obtain the raider axe you must first complete the Melancholic Vikings Quests or buying 1 from ah. To complete the Vikings quest you are going to need a magical water bucket, fish and a fish hat. All of these items are easily obtainable. To get the coins for the raiders axe you can do 1 or 2 things, Foraging & Fishing. When foraging it is recommended that you mine the highest selling wood that's currently on bazaar. To start fishing you will need a normal fishing rod which you can buy from the fish merchant. To start fishing purchase a lure 6 book from the ah and combine it onto your rod. Then swap between Park lobbies until you find one where it is raining, this is where you will be fishing. Once you reach squid collection 1 craft a squid hat and continue fishing. You will need to fish until you collect approximately 300-400 ink sacks. Sell these to Bazaar and you should have enough money to afford the raiders axe. Worrying about anvil uses now is a bad thing. To enchant the raiders axe you will need to make a complete enchanting table and pull up a list of the enchantments, which can be found HERE. You will need to mine emeralds at the deep caverns with full lapis armor on and once reaching 60 levels grab a book and enchant it with one of the needed enchants, You will then repeat this process adding the books onto the raiders axe. NOTE: this will take a while. \n\nStep 7: Dungeons Gear.\nWith your new raider axe its time to grind some coins. Head to the diamond reserve in the deep caverns and grind some mobs. After getting around 20k and some mobs drops head back to the hub, selling all the loot received. With the coins received its time to purchase some dungeon gear. Head over to the auction house and find some floor 0-3 dungeon gear going for cheap on the ah, (NOT BIN). Bid on each of these pieces. As of now Skeleton Soldier or Zombie Knight will be the best armor set for you.\nIf needed head back to the Deep Caverns to grind out some more money. With your New Raiders Axe and Dungeons Armor Its time for the END.\n\nStep 8: The End.\nThis step is simple. Test your damage. With your raiders axe and Skeleton Soldier/Zombie Knight you should be able to 1 tap the 4.5k Eman. If not don't panic!!! You may need to get some talismans to do this and I recommend watching @ThirtyVirus Video that can be found HERE. After watching this craft as many talismans as you can until you can 1tap the enderman. Once you can 1 tap the enderman grind them until you get a COMMON enderman pet. This pet will be your carry pet up until you can get a uncommon Tiger from the traveling zoo (always have enough mats for it spare, you never know when it will pop up). After getting a common enderman pet leveling it up is essential. I recommend getting it to level 50 before moving ahead.\n\nStep 9: Dungeons!!!\nThe most controversial step. Grind entrance floors for lost adventurers and catacombs level. Once you feel prepared enough floor 1 is always there. Dungeons is one of the easiest ways to make money in the early game. Getting secrets can award you with around 50k per run. Your runs though will not be for profit, they will be for gear only. You will need to get your catacombs level as high as possible. Once a high enough catacombs level purchase a Zombie Soldier Cutlass. This sword is extremely good and will help you a lot.\n\nMore Coming Soon!!!"

I also changed the Baby Yeti pet, which is a change from a previous post I made.\n\nFirst, lets talk about the Baby Yeti.\n\nIn my opinion, the Baby Yeti pet is not a mage pet, so I made a few changes to its stats and its Shocking Slam perk.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges\n- Removed Intelligence buff\n- Added +30% Crit Damage\n-Changed Yeti Fury ability, adding +100 Strength to the Yeti Sword and increased Intelligence by 300\n- Changed Ability 2 (used to be Ice Shields) to Ability 3 (used to be Shocking Slam)\n- Changed Shocking Slam damage from Intelligence to Strength\n\nIdea for compensation for players who used Epic Baby Yeti pet and liked the Ice Shields perk, decreased price from 20m to upgrade from Kat to 5m, and changed the time required to 4 days (from 12).\n\nNEW F8 ITEM IDEAS!\n(please note these are ideas, as said in the TITLE!)\n\nGreater Orb Of Healing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrafted with 4 Lesser Orb of Healing, this item is a significant upgrade to the previous tier.\nNote that the Strength buff does not increase by 5% each second, it just increases your Strength by 5% once. (ex, 1000 str. to 1050 str.)\n\nDetonate Bow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink of it as an Explosive Bow, but better! You can spam a few detonators, then detonate them, dealing massive amounts of damage, like tens of millions of damage! I might increase the detonator duration, because 5s seems a little short.\n\nWither Knight Armor\nI did not make the full set, that would take too long. Imagine that there are 4 pieces, and the chestplate gives the most hp and def and boots give the least.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn incredibly strong set, giving large sums of defense, strength and crit damage. It's ability deflects projectiles (arrows, wither skulls, skeleton master bolts, etc) and shoots it back at them! All pieces can be found in Emerald or higher except for chestplate, which is only found in Bedrock, costing 12m to buy.\n\nGoldor's Staff, Golden Skull + Reforge!\n3 new ideas in 1!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Goldor's Staff has a unique ability. You right-click to throw the staff and it will circle around you, (like the bone helmet bones, but faster and wider radius!) and the Goldor's Staff will turn into a Golden Nugget (placeholder, like the Bonemerang). Press Right Click again to bring back the Goldor's Staff!\nThis sword is exclusively found in Bedrock Chests and costs 15m to buy.\n\nThat's all!

    "body": "So I think its really strange how coops work in terms of leaving. I could be wrong about this but I think its bad how when you leave a coop you can NEVER rejoin it. I'm sure me and lots have other people have had this problem. So I left my coop. This was before I knew I could not rejoin btw, but that's besides the point. Anyway, I wanted to rejoin and my friends told me that there was a 48 hour period before I could rejoin. So I looked it up and started seeing I couldnt rejoin my coop. This is annoying for many reasons.\n\n1. All the progress made in the last months that people will have and maybe even the past YEAR is gone.\n2. Maybe you want a break from your coop and decide leaving, but you then want to rejoin. BUT YOU CANT\n3. You might have accidentally deleted your profile and now can't get it back.\n\nI suggest this feature is removed and replaced with a recovery period.\n\nWithin 30 days of deleting a profile your deleted profile goes into a limbo. It doesn't show up in the profile manager as to not take up space but will show up next to the profile manager in an icon called \"Profile recovery\"\nThis would work like within 30 days of your profile being deleted, all your data exists, and nothing gets deleted. You have that 30 day time frame to rejoin or start back up the profile with everything restored.\n\nI'm not sure why you cant rejoin a coop but if anyone sees something like this (specifically a staff) please say why that this isnt a feature or if you can add it or not. Because this is something that a lot of things do, so I don't see why sky block cant do it.\nI have seen a lot of people commenting \"Its your fault for not reading the big bold text\" I chose to delete my profile, even though i regret it, I have accepted that I cant get it back. None of my posts are active attempts to change my specific circumstances, but generally change the circumstances of everyone else. Other people have made mistakes like accidentally deleting the wrong profile, they also can't get anything back. So actually read the post, its not me asking for my profile back.\n\nAlso, obviously there are exceptions. If a coop was actively participating in a duplication glitch or macroing, then their profile gets completely wiped, no getting it back. But as for completely legitimate profiles, a profile recovery system needs to exist.\n\nalso i get that there is like a 1 in 1000 chance anyone who can get this into the game will see this but if people see it then thats all i want."

    "title": "[IDEA] Abandoned Mines v1.1 (effort post? | more than zero positive reactions)",
    "body": "Before the actual thread starts, i just wanna say one thing: I was going to delete this first, as i didn't really like how at the end it became less fun and more of a task just to do the thing because i'm already too far in. This isn't really good, but i just couldn't delete so much progress. Even though i did it like, 4 times already...\n\nSo at some point, i finally accepted that all both of my idea threads are absolutely dead and bumping them would make no sense. Luckily, i had a creative explosion at 2 AM and hello again.\n\nPart 0: How to access\nAbandoned Mines are located in Deep Caverns and require Combat 11 to enter. The portal is on the back of the island, behind the cliff with a fairy soul.\n\nPart 1: Design and purpose\nAbandoned Mines are mostly caves with a lot of open space made in mostly gray and dark gray colors. It's a mining-combat area, in which you can find Diamonds and Quartz as well as strong monsters and a boss.\n\nPart 2: Enemies\nThis part is well, what the title says. I'm just gonna list the mobs, what they drop and how much Combat XP they give.\nUndead Miner - A zombie with 1,500 Health and 360 Damage. They drop 2-4 Rotten Flesh, Ench. Rotten Flesh with a 5% chance and 24 Combat XP.\nCrazy Geologist - A zombie with 2,000 Health and 375 Damage. They drop 3-4 Rotten Flesh, Ench. Rotten Flesh with a 5% chance and 27 Combat XP.\nMindless Guard - A skeleton with 2,250 Health and 390 Damage. They drop 3-5 Bones, Ench. Bones with a 5% chance and 20 Combat XP.\n\nPart 3: Memory Pieces and the bossfight\n\"Mindless Guard\" is a strange name for a creature living in mines, isn't it? Obviously enough, they're guarding a place. To be exact, the Expedition Base. They start appearing as you go further in the area rather simply wandering around. The Expedition Base itself is a place for a bossfight. It's an area with tons of open space and some ruins, which appear to be something humans used down there to survive. Here's how a classic room in the base looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\n(pls dont send hate i suck at building) Notice that ender frame over there? Honestly, i kinda felt like it's weird down in the mines, but it's the only way to tell people \"you gotta put things in the frame for the boss to appear\" that i thought of. But what to put in there? Memory Pieces. These are gray and white heads dropped from the Mindless Guards with a 1/350 chance. If you wanna see how one would look ingame, launch Minecraft 1.8.9 and do\n/give @p skull 1 3 {SkullOwner:\"random_gamergirl\"}\nOnce a Memory Piece is put into the frame, it disappears and you get a Forgotten Memory. It's basically a Memory Piece made in darker colors. Using your Place/Use with a Forgotten Memory key will remove the piece from the frame and replace it with a Memory Piece again.\nAlright, that's about it for Memory Pieces. Now the boss.\nExpedition Leader is summoned after 9 Memory Pieces are put in the altar. Himself, he is a normal person with a player skin. With a pretty large amount of 8M Health, he's hard to kill. Well actually no, this guy would die in 5 seconds. To prevent that, he also has a \"Shield\" ability: All damage above 150k is reduced back to 150,000 making the Expedition Leader battles way longer than they would be. Now, the boss has multiple phases.\nPhase 1: Starts when summoned. The boss summons Mindless Guards with 40k health and 450 Damage each for 5 seconds, 2 of them in one second (for a total of 10).\nPhase 2: Starts once the buffed guards are defeated. The leader himself goes into battle, having 1350 Damage therefore being extremely dangerous. Along with his melee Iron Sword attack, he also has a ranged bow attack - He uses it every 3 seconds, the arrows start home towards a random player always dealing 35% of their current health.\nPhase 3: Starts at 5M health. Similar to phase 2, but the leader teleports near a random player every 5 seconds, making it impossible to camp in one spot to avoid all damage and leaving the boss to others.\nPhase 4: Starts at 3M health. (This one is inspired by Zethes-Rainbow's post) The boss instantly summons 20 Mindless Guards with 90,000 health and starts a charge attack for 90 seconds. If the players fail to defeat the Mindless Guards, a lightning strikes every player. This \"drains\" the damage dealt to the boss, recovering him back to 5M health and starting Phase 3 again. The lightnings themself do a damage equal to 30% current health of a player.\n\nPart 4: Expedition Leader rewards\nExpedition Leader is a pretty hard boss, so the rewards are good too.\nAt first, let's take a look at how the chances for certain drops are calculated. The system uses the Weight system already used by Dragons. Placing a Memory Piece grants 85 Weight, Scoring first grants 270, Scoring third grants 215 and scoring third grants 170. Now to the drops. The main thing you wanna get from the Leader is \"Expedition Suit\" - A set of armor. A helmet requires 300 Weight, chestplate requires 365, leggings 325, boots 270. Although the stats are the same, the pieces will still cost a different amount because of how hard it is to get a chestplate compared to boots. Speaking of stats...\nStat: Piece stats | Total stats\nHP: 110 | 440\nDefense: 130 | 520\nStrength: 20 | 80\nSpeed: 2 | 8\nIntelligence: 10 | 40\nThere's no set bonus from the Expedition Suit.\nAnother drop from the boss is the Miner's Daggerknife. It's an iron sword and has a drop chance of 8% when 440 Weight is reached. With 175 Damage and 90 Strength, it's basically a worse version of the AOTD. It also has an ability: Activated with RMB. Throw the knife, dealing 0-25% more damage on hit depending on distance traveled. When thrown, the knife only comes back after 3 seconds and can't be used. Missing the shot does not cancel this. With no Mana cost and 20s Cooldown, this is a pretty useful melee-ranged weapon for early-mid game.\n\nPart 5: Other minor things\nThese are extremely small notes that don't deserve their own part, but still do exist.\n-There are 12 Fairy Souls in this area.\n-There are no drop chances to the Expedition Suit. You will always get the best piece you can get with your weight.\n-More coming in future updates if people like this one!\n\nPart 6: Afterwords\nYeah, i'm really not sure about this one... It's so far my least favorite out of the ones i made, but i guess i'll just post this here. Won't bump too much, but i still appreciate it if you do! I think i'll focus more on making minor ideas like talismans, swords and just making a single item per thread. I don't hope you liked this one, it honestly turned out straight up bad. Why am i even posting it? I don't know, i just felt like deleting an almost finished thread is too much even for a near perfectionist like me.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Updates\n\n\n\nv1.0 - Thread posted\nv1.1 - Boss greatly nerfed (Suggested by Ma1ngo)"

    "body": "Okay, so I was foraging recently, and I was looking around, and I noticed something. There is no dedicated armor for foraging. Most people were either using Young armor or something random. So I though of something.\n\nIntroducing: The Monkey Suit!\n\n\nSpoiler: Armor Stats\n\n\n\n(Epic Rarity)\nEach Piece (All pieces have the same stats):\n10 Health\n15 Speed\n5 Pet Luck\n1 Ferocity\n(It gives Pet Luck and Ferocity because, well, it's wild!) (Also, it's the first armor with Pet Luck)\nAbilities:\n\nFull Set Bonus:\nSkilled Forager:\nFor every 2 foraging levels, this armor gets +8% stats (+200% maximum) and a 0.5% foraging xp boost (12.5% maximum).\n\n(Boots Only) Vine Swing:\nAllows you to double jump! Upon double jumping, gain +20 speed for 10 seconds (does not stack). Mana cost: 50\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Crafting Recipe\n\n\n\nThis armor's recipe is unlocked in Jungle Wood VIII (8) instead of the 1,000 foraging xp it is now.\nIt is crafted with 23 stacks of enchanted jungle wood and one wood singularity in the \"normal armor pattern\", with the wood singularity in the middle of the chestplate.\n\nThis armor just looks like leather armor with the monkey pet texture (or something similar) as the helmet.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Monkey Suit's Impact on the Game\n\n\n\nThis suit would obviously be used mostly for foraging, with the speed boost, vine swing ability, and foraging xp boost being used to improve the foraging experience. This suit could also be used for zealot grinding if you have a high foraging level, because it has a maximum speed boost of 180 (with foraging 50), which is slightly more than young armor, although it would be balanced because it has low EHP (after all, why would you need EHP for foraging?).\n\nThis armor is also unique because it gives pet luck, so it could be used if you want to be the pet-luckiest person in SkyBlock. At foraging 50, the full armor set would give 60 pet luck, which is quite a bit, and could be used as a money-making method to craft legendary pets far more commonly.\n\nThis armor also gives ferocity, because why not? \n\n\n\nLet me know what you think of this idea, it is my first, so I appreciate any feedback.\nThanks for Reading!"

    "title": "Why ghost damage doesn't grant a competitive advantage",
    "body": "Various dragons that are killed across the end are usually accompanied by at least one person who complains about ghost damage. Everyone seems to hate mages present outside of dungeons because of their ability to do stupid amounts of damage to dragons, also known as 'ghost damage.' Ghost damage is the portion of damage dealt to a dragon, in which it registers as accumulated damage on your end, but not on the dragon's. This supposedly allows you to do unusually large amounts of damage to dragons in certain lobbies. At first glance, this is an exploitable bug. However, the damage you deal to the dragon doesn't affect the damage other's deal. If you deal 100k damage as ghost damage to the dragon, it doesn't register on the dragon's health, meaning that you have left 100k damage for other people to deal as well. This means that the amount of damage you do is proportional to how much damage others do, which is why people who do 20m+ on dragons usually are done in terrible lobbies. Therefore, this relationship is mutual, and ghost damage doesn't grant any competitive advantages.\n\nNote that this is coming from an Elegant Tuxedo sweat who isn't a mage and does dragons on a consistent basis.\n\nEdit: I'm not saying that the admins shouldn't remove this. I'm just stating that ghost damage isn't an advantage."

    "body": "Will the Aspect Of the Dragons sword prices ever come out of their Depression?\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\nHopefully Yes, But There are many better swords e.g The Livid Dagger. The Aspect of the Dragons, about a month ago was worth 2 Million coins for a clean one.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\nThey have dropped down to 1.2M in a little over a month. The Dragon armors are dropping as well. The Superior dragon armor used to be 60-55 Million coins, and now its 40-50M coins! Why? To be honest, I am not completely sure, Whether it be the\nShadow Assassin armor, or summoning eyes dropping.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\nBut back to the question. Will the AOTD Ever rise again? This is not Certain at the time. It could drop, or rise. One thing to note is It used to be an amazing sword, but there are just so many better swords nowadays. If you have the money, go for a Livid Dagger.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\nIf you're just looking for a sword to grind Zealots, Get an AOTD, you'll only need to deal 13k damage without a crit.\nNow Obviously it's a personal preference, and I well... I prefer the AOTD. The AOTD Will most likely Rise when either the Eyes rise, or it gets a buff (if it gets a buff). Another thing to note is how many AOTD's are in the market right now. With more swords, there's not enough buyers, so people will drop their prices in order to sell them\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\nMy Conclusion is The sword will most likely either stay the same price, or drop more.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\nIf I am wrong about anything, Please correct me in the replies  Have a good day!\n_______________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________"

    "title": "Spider Slayer Rework and Improvements (Suggestion)",
    "body": "Spider slayer.\nQuite possibly the worst slayer, in the most unloved map.\n\nThe spider's den is constantly crowded, making it take 10x longer than it should just to spawn the boss, with people constantly killing your minibosses, and then killing the Tarantula Broodfather you summon. It's clear it needs a rework.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: My ideas\n\n\n\n- Firstly, I believe the spider's den should be fully reworked. The map itself is a pain to navigate, as it is full of cobwebs and random holes, and the spiders themselves give very little combat exp. when combined with the difficulty of actually killing a spider, it takes far longer to spawn a Tarantula Broodfather than any other slayer boss.\n- Secondly, a random lobby feature, similar to that in the hub, could be added. This would allow you to get private lobbies for the spider's den, like for all of the other slayer areas (castle, crypt), without having to spend your entire day trying to find one.\n- Thirdly, a new area could be created in the hub, like the Castle and Crypt. This would allow players to more easily do spider slayer while still being in a private server, without the need to add new servers to Skyblock.\n\nThese are all my ideas. I am in no way saying these will be added, this is just what I believe could be added to make spider slayer less mentally painful.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Other ideas\n\n\n\n- Make the Tarantula Broodfather AI better, and not just constantly jumping in holes - L6st62deepforge\n- Remove cobwebs from the Spider's Den - L6st62deepforge\n\n\n\nIf you have any ideas which haven't been mentioned, feel free to post them in the replies. I will add them to the \"Other ideas\" section with credit to you; spider slayer does need to be improved, and getting more ideas from the community will give the Admins more suggestions on how to do this."

The essence shop will be more usable\n\nidk if you have any thing else I should add tell me.\n\n\nCONS:\nidk\n\n\nSo I saw a few argument and I responded to them, now I\u2019ll copy and paste it here.\n\nI see people saying some stuff and adding some stuff that would be bad. I\u2019ll address them here.\n\nin terms of lowering the price, no. Why?\n\nmore people can sell=lower price\nMore people can buy=higher price\n\nlower price+higher price~same price\n\nbut...\nRn you can\u2019t buy essence and use it in dungeons shop, so there for it will ACTUALLY make the prices go up.\n\nSom1 else said you can but yourself through dungeons, no just no.\nFirstly you can buy already stared items, but yes it will give you acces to some buffs but then.. honestly you won\u2019t become good at dungeons with catacombs 12 just cuz you have all essence buffs maxed. And by that point you will have spent so much on essence that you will be doing dungeons in unstable.\n\nanother good idea multiple people said was having another npc sell it. I think that\u2019s a good idea since essence isn\u2019t a item.\n\nyet another idea som1 said was having it so that you have to obtained the essence, that would also be good cuz then you have to grind, even if it\u2019s a little, at least something to buy.\n\nanother of my own ideas is maybe having a catacombs req but each essence.\n\nall these 3 ideas won\u2019t be on bazar but I do think that the box would function similar\n\n\nPoll:\n\n\n\n\n\nPoll don\u2019t bump, just vote after reading my thread\n\n\nhttps://hypixel.net/threads/should-essence-be-added-to-bazar.3442086/ Read, then vote. please don\u2019t bump this poll. Also I will maybe make a third poll.\n\n\n\n\nhypixel.net\n\n\n\n\n\n@Abyssr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[IDEA] You should be able to trade Essence. (25+ positive reactions)\n\n\nas thinking most of the people who got scammed was scammed by essence, so i think you should be able to trade them just like back in the days when you couldnt trade coins leading people to get scammed. it should look like this Wither essence will repesent as the wither essence head Undead...\n\n\n\n\nhypixel.net\n\n\n\n\n\nif an1 would want to make a kind of screen to se how it would look like feel free to post it and I\u2019ll add it if it\u2019s not something stupid like a apple renamed to tomato.\n\nThat\u2019s it.

    "body": "As a follow up to my guide about all of the drops and how to get them, I felt like I should make a guide on how to kill the incredibly difficult Legendary Griffin mobs.\n\nHere is the guide to the drops: https://hypixel.net/threads/all-myt...-40-positive-reactions.3417737/#post-24258730\n\n\nHere it is!\n\nGear\nArmor: You are going to want to go with a Reaper Mask, and a combination of T12 Perfect and Necromancer Armor.\n\nSword: There is really only 1 viable sword for this, and that is the Sword of Revelations.\n\nOther Gear: You will want a Manaflux/Overflux Power Orb, an Ornate/Florid Zombie Sword, and a Wand of Restoration.\n\n\nMobs\nMinos Hunter: This shouldn't be super difficult, just whack it a few times, and it should die pretty easily.\n\nSiamese Lynxes: Same thing, just switch between hitting each Lynx.\n\nMinotaur: Again, same idea. Try to get it into a corner where you can constantly hit it. This might be more difficult, but just use your Power Orb, Zombie Sword, and Wand, and you should be okay.\n\nGaia Construct: Hit it a few times, and then jump over it, and hit it again. Repeat until it's dead.\n\nMinos Champion: Try to lure it into a corner, and hit it with your Sword of Revelations. Be sure to use your Power Orb, Zombie Sword, and Wand on this one, as it is extremely challenging.\n\nMinos Inquisitor: This I just don't know. Not many people can kill it. You will have to have extremely high skills, lots of talismans, and the best gear possible to even have a chance of killing it. If you are trying to take one down, assemble a team of high tier players, and you might be able to do it. Good luck killing this thing. It is a beast.\n\n\n\nAnyway, that's all the tips I can give. I hope this helped!\nGood luck out there!\u200b"

Players would have there gamertag when you go to vote and there perks down bellow and running should cost about 100m and you skill avrage has to be 20 like i said before this will make your game more fun overall. p.s (if you decide to do this can i get my name in the comminty center)"

After a little bit of googling I found that they are used for catalyst, which were going for about 25k a piece. BUT the thing is it was all the way at endstone 9, and crystal frags were going for around 20k a piece. So I get to endstone 9, and then advertise that I'm buying crystal frags (on ah and from adverts), making them into catalysts, and selling them on the bazaar. Now when I started I was the ONLY person doing this from what I could tell. Now this method made me around 2.5-3m and hour if i really tried. Now after like 10 days of doing this, people start to catch on to what I was doing. Then they started to refuse to sell for only 20k, making my method worthless. Then everyone was like \"woah, i can make money off of what this dude is doing\" and now all your end lobby's are spammed with \"BuYiNg CrYsTaL FrAgS 4Ok!\" \n\nTL;DR\nI am the frag man\nI am sorry\n\nCredit to LlamaBlade for this \"I ruined skyblock\" idea, this was my version of it though"

My solution to this would be a separate world. Nothing has changed from the old one except everyone starts again on an even playing field without having their progress wiped. So you can switch between the old world and new world as you please. The different worlds have their own AHs Bazaars, leaderboards etc. In order to implement this i think it could be when starting a new profile, you would have an option to select which world you would like to be in or something like that. I think this would be a good solution idk if this has been suggested before I'm not claiming it as an original idea but I haven't seen it. All I've seen is everyone gets wiped or new players are at a disadvantage. \n\nEdited for clarity"

Adds a new type of essence, \u201cMagical Essence\u201d. Instead of withers and necromancers, there\u2019s spiders and druids.\n\nNew Ophelia Items\n\nThe Catacombs has three series of items you can buy from Ophelia: The Healer's helmets, the mage's goggles, and the archer's bows. So for the new dungeon, I felt it was only right to include items for the Tanks and Berserkers out there.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Druid's Mask\n\n\n\n\nHerbalist\u2019s Mask (Entrance)\n\n\n\n\n\nAgromancer\u2019s Mask (F4)\n\n\n\n \n\nFloramancer\u2018s Mask (F7)\n\n\n\n \n\nDruid\u2019s Mask (F10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Cactus' Sword\n\n\n\n\nCactus\u2019 Thorn (Entrance)\n\n\n\n \n\nCactus\u2019 Spike (F4)\n\n\n\n \n\nCactus\u2019 Dagger (F7)\n\n\n\n \n\nCactus\u2019 Sword (F10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBosses\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Bosses + Lore\n\n\n\nEntrance Floor - Menvar - God of Knowledge - Has no form. Only visible part of them is an eyeball in the back of the blood room that watches players - Probably stronger than all the other bosses but not much is known about her. Summons spiders and evil plants.\n\nFloor 1 - Erragor - Baby Druid - NPC - Enthusiastic new druid. Eager to prove themselves in battle. Summons weak spiders and plants.\n\nFloor 2 - Agrathon - Acolyte Druid - NPC - Beginner Druid. Started learning two years ago and considers himself a master. Uses an excessive amount of Flytraps, because he thinks they look cool.\n\nFloor 3 - Tetraphine - Enlightened Druid - Slime - Oddball Druid. Spends most of his time sitting in a garden. Claims that he is one with his plants. Doesn\u2019t summon any plants, but attacks you directly using plant-related abilities.\n\nFloor 4 - Solus - Professional Druid - NPC - Long-Time Druid. Sells plants for a living. Claims he thinks it\u2019s lame but secretly loves his career. Uses a wide variety of houseplants.\n\nFloor 5 - Retson - Cardinal Druid - Slime - Religious leader of the Druids. Greatly respected Druid. Claims he\u2019s a pacifist, so he has his plants attack you instead (under his command, of course). Uses extensions of his own body to attack, through plants.\n\nFloor 6 - Grechavich - King Druid - NPC - King of the Druids. A very happy-go-lucky king. Enjoys sunbathing and going on long walks. Cares deeply about his plants, so they\u2019ve become very strong and connected. Uses only a small number of very strong plants.\n\nFloor 7 - Hamon - Spiderling - Cave Spider - Just born. Determined to prove themselves to the Spider Queen and become the next Spider Lord. Fairly arrogant. Doesn\u2019t summon anything, just him and his best friends.\n\nFloor 8 - Ziggur - Spider Gladiator - Spider NPC - Very strong. Wants to rise to power, but respects his leader. Fights like he would in an arena, using weapons, traps, and animals to his advantage.\n\nFloor 9 - Zygoth - Spider Lord - Spider - Heir to the throne. Fairly brash, but cares deeply for the Spider Empire. Thinks slimes look funny, so he calls on them to fight for him.\n\nFloor 10 - Esmerelda - Spider Queen - Spider - Elderly spider.

Just because our stats does not add up (such as good armor and weap but low skill XP) doesn't mean we must be IRL traders.\n\nMy legit P2W friends and I have been accused numerous times by some random dudes, searching us up on skylea and accusing us for IRL trade and reporting us. An easy way to solve this issue is by adding the fame rank to the SkyBlock public API, that way the websites such as skylea can display it. Fame rank directly reflects how much cookie you have bought using gems, and therefore a way to indicate whether you are an IRL trader or a legit cookie trader.\n\nMy IGN is always PotatoMaster101. If you see me in a lobby, please don't come up to me and be like \"you are very sus, are you IRL trading?\". Below is a screenshot of my fame rank to prove my legit cookie P2W:\n\n\n\n\n(as a note, my goal is to hit 100mil fame)\n\nAs a P2W player, I am supporting the Hypixel server. Without donation from players, there will be no Hypixel. There are numerous forms of donations - such as ranks, mystery boxes, boosters, and most recent SkyBlock Gems.\n\nYou can say I am wasting my money or I am stupid for paying or blah blah blah, but I will not mind it. I just cannot tolerate people reporting legit P2W players as IRL traders and trying to get them banned.\n\nThanks,\nPotatoMaster101"

Then, suddenly, he found himself in a loop. Whenever he leveled up slayers, he had to level up again. He got to wolf 8 without an overflux. He got to spider 9 without a tarantula talisman. He got to zombie 8 without a scythe blade. He kept going, wasting all his money, and eventually his eyes died of boredom."

    "body": "Okay so this is an idea a posted about before,with a few other ideas.\n\nI know this is looks long but its not much.\n\n\nFirst Idea.\n\nSo I had thought of something for mage class An Epic Dungeon Item called The Spell Book the item would be an enchanted book dropped from f6,f7 and f8.\n\nIt would have 5 different spells I will list below It would be cycled by Left-Clicking and it would be activated by Right-Clicking.\n\n1.Rush:Gives all players within an 8 block radius 15 strength and 25 speed for 20 seconds with a 1 Minute and 30 seconds cooldown.\nMana Cost 150\n2.Barrier:It would basically be the barrier Scarf and The Professor have but it only lasts for 10 seconds and has a 2 Minute cooldown.\nMana Cost 400\n3.WitherLord: Shoots 3 wither skulls at enemies in an 8 block radius with a 1 second cooldown.\nMana Cost 50\n4.Heal.Heals all players in an 10 block radius to max health with a 30 second cooldown (basically a worse version of wish)\nMana Cost 50\n5.EarthQuake: It would be similar to the yeti sword ability but instead of sending the terrain far it would have very little distance but do massive damage and have a 10 second cooldown.\nMana Cost 125\n\nGetting this from a dungeon chest would be rare maybe a 5% chance and it would cost 2Mil maybe.\nEdits to the spells where suggested by @FirewallTehGod <3\n\n\nSecond Idea.\n\n\nA new miniboss for dungeons called the Shadow Master the upgrade to the Shadow Assassin.\n\nIt would use the same skin but would have Iron Boots and would have a diamond sword that sword would be the Shadow Fury not a Silent Death(the weapon that shadow assassins use)\n\nIt would use the Shadow Fury ability if more than 3 players are a radius of 8 blocks.\n\nAnd another thing it could do is blind players if you get to close.\nIt would also blind players if they get hit when it uses the Shadow Fury ability.\n\n\n\nThird Idea\n\n\n\nRune Merchant.\n\nNothing to special just an NPC that buys and sells runes.\n\n\n\nForth Idea.\n\n\n\nThe Exterminator.\n\nThis would be a miniboss for higher dungeons floor (f8 or higher).\n\n\nIt would use a Diamond Axe and be very dangerous.\n\nIt would be extremely fast and be able to throw its axe (similar to the berserk ability).\n\n\nThe Final Idea.\n\n\nAnother miniboss for dungeons lol.\n\n\n\nThe WitherMaster\n\n\nHe would be a Wither Skeleton holding a Diamond Shovel that shoots Heat Seeking Wither skulls very quickly.\n\nSimilar to King Midas you have to break his armor to kill him."

    "title": "[IDEA] Lost Head of Herobrine, best damage pet in game?? (only 1 on server with a huge scavenger hunt to find)",
    "body": "The Lost Head of Herobrine is a corrupted pet (obfuscated text instead of rarity name). There can only be one of them on the server, and I will elaborate on obtaining further. It gives +1 strength, +1% crit damage, +0.5% crit chance, and +1 intelligence per level. It's abilities are:\nTeleportation - increases the range of the Aspect of the End's instant transmission by 1% per level\nCurse - Inflict max level of every debuff to whatever you hit\nStalk- Gain +1 base damage to an enemy per level after hitting it (does stack)\nImmortality - Outside of dungeons, you cannot die. The least amount of health you can have is 1, and once you get hit with 1 health, you get teleported to the spawn of the map you are in. You do not lose coins, potion effects, or anything else. You still stay at 1 health, but it can be healed with items like regeneration potions or a zombie sword. When you are saved, a message in chat says to you: \"The rage of an unknown force has refused to let you pass on to the afterlife. For now you live.\" This is put at the last priority if you have a Saving Grace or a Remnant of the Eye. If the ability is activated in Dungeons, it says \"Somehow, the force of a thousand souls could not save you. Complete the Dungeon to reactivate your curse.\"\nConclusion: By far this is the best dps pet, but it is also by far the rarest. Also, this is very 2013 lmao\n\nObtaining: You can obtain this by completing the Water Puzzle in dungeons in under 1 minute. Once you open the chest, it grants you the mysterious key. A message in chat says to you: \"A strange key... Maybe you should speak to someone who knows about strange objects.\" If you talk to Maddox the Slayer with this in your hand, he will say: \"What? What am I supposed to do with this?\" If you hand him a Locked Safe, which has a 1/5000 chance of being fished up, he will say: \"Oh. You want me to unlock it for you. Here.\" He will then hand you an Unlocked Safe and an Emerald Key. You can then discard the Unlocked Safe, as it doesn't do anything. Once the Emerald Key is in your inventory, a message in chat says to you: \"Something is telling you that you need to speak to someone who loves emeralds. If you speak to Romero when he is at the Emerald Altar with the Emerald Key in your hand, he will say: \"Hey! A key! I love keys. And it's made out of Emerald! Even better!\" If you try to mine the Emerald Altar, he says: \"Oh. You want me to unlock that. Got it.\" He will then try to unlock the emerald altar, and it will explode, dealing 50,000 true damage. This is only possible to survive while wearing Mastiff Armor. If you die, the whole challenge gets reset and the Key gets voided. If you do survive, Romero says: \"Wow! That was a big explosion. Are you OK? Luckily I am, because I am an NPC. Anyway, could you hand this chunk of the altar to Juliette? I'm sure she would love it!\" A message in chat then says to you: \"I'm sure she would not. Take it to someone who has experience with the mine, someone that could examine it for you.\" If you hand it to Juliette, the quest will progress as normal and you will lose your Emerald Chunk. If you bring it to the Lazy Miner, he will say: \"Wowie! That's one nice emerald. Here, take this strange orb I found while mining, I don't know what to do with it.\" If you hand that in to mayor Notch (a rare mayor that runs a special shop that sells special unique items), he will say: \"Watch your back.\" You will then be stuck in place, and if you turn behind you, Herobrine will run towards you at a fast speed and kill you. When you respawn, you will respawn in a room with Herobrine's head on the floor. If you right click it, you will obtain the first and only Lost Head of Herobrine pet on the server. Congratulations!"

    "body": "Video Link:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/channel/UCgl_XCClf1AM2BwehPRVSag\n\ntl:dr of video\n\nSo first, let\u2019s define what late and end game players are.\n\nLate Game\n\nStrong Dragon Armor or Mastiff or Tarantula Armor\n\nAND\n\nAOTD/Pigmans/Thick Tacticians\n\nAround 25m+ in net worth\n\nEnd Game\n\nSuperior Dragon Armor/Perfect X-XII\n\n50mil Midas\n\nOR 75m+ in net worth\n\nThus with the generic definitions out of the way, let\u2019s get started with the money making methods.\n\n1. Zealot grinding\n\nReally straightforward, the OG of the OG of grinding methods.\n\nYou have 2 strategies for this method.\n\n1.) Young/Speed strategy Essentially get young dragon armor + AOTD/Pigmans/Thick Tacticians and use the extra speed to kill zealots quickly.\n\n2.) Explosive Strategy Get a sword that does 13,000 damage and an explosive bow. Shoot the arrow near the zealot and swap your to your main sword to make the explosive bow deal the damage of your main sword. Allowing you to shoot zealots from just a pillar without moving.\n\n2.) Auction Flipping\n\nBasically, buy items for cheap during off peak hours or during spooky events. And sell them during peak hours for extra coins to profit!\n\nIt\u2019s hard to learn at the start but it\u2019s easy to master the profits once you\u2019re experienced. I have a more specific rundown in this method in my video since I don\u2019t want this post to be 3 pages Long.\n\n3.) Slayer grinding\n\nMy favourite of the bunch, just grind T3 Tarantula, T4 Sven or T3 Sven for profits.\n\nGrind the base materials, buy slaves to help you click enchanted materials. Craft the silk/gold teeth and craft them into items to sell on the AH for profits.\n\nT4 Sven will give less profits than T3 Tarantula and T3 Sven but for T4 Sven, you\u2019re gunning for the hope of an Overflux capacitor.\n\n4.) Dragon grinding\n\nRecommended:\n\nTarantula/ Tarantula Helmet + 3/4 strong\n\nDH 3+, Power 6, HPB Runaan\u2019s bow\n\n50mil Midas/End sword with DH 5 (optional)\n\n10m+ to bid on eyes\n\nSimple strategy, Do the best damage, hope for Strong/Superior dragons, if a boomer dragon spawns, hope for an AOTD.\n\nSell to the Ah and profit.\n\nOnce you have the money, you now have 4 paths to choose for your end game road.\n\n1.) Hoarder\n\nJust store coins, don\u2019t buy anything, simple.\n\n2.) superior + 50mil Midas\n\nJust get a superior dragon set and a 50mil Midas. The best path in the meta at the moment.\n\n3.) Off-Meta/Collector\n\nBasically you just invest in items which you believe may see use in the future, such as Perfect 12, Scythe, Overflux and mosquito bow.\n\nSome players in this path also go on to collect every item in hypixel skyblock such as Diver\u2019s armor, and Yeti Sword\n\n4.) Skill Grinder/All-minion slots\n\nThe title explains it. Basically, you spend your coins on materials to upgrade your minions to help you get more skill EXP and you buy skill EXP potions to speed up the process.\n\nAnd with that, I hope I helped to explain the late-end game bridge you guys may want to consider traveling! If there are any improvements please comment down below or in the YouTube comments, I\u2019ll try to respond to them as soon as possible."

    "body": "(I mentioned this in my little Avengers post, but no one is going to see it there, so I thought I would discuss it separately.)\n\nSimple idea: Skyblock should add explosives to the archer's bag of tricks. This would fit with archers' play style, and honestly it would just be fun. (I don't play archer, by the way.)\n\nHere are some thoughts about what that could look like:\n\n(1) Archers could place an explosive and then use a detonator to ignite it from a certain distance. (Ranged weapons, get it?) The detonator would have like a 30-second cool down.\n\n(2) Blast radius would scale with archer-class level--maybe an additional half-block per level.\n\n(3) \"Expertise\" would scale with class level, too. The idea here is that explosives would always have a chance of damaging the archer's teammates (the risk of friendly fire), but that chance would decrease as they gained experience=levels. (Maybe it starts at 50% and decreases by one percent per level.)\n\n(4) There would be several types of explosives they could use. For example: (a) a fire-bomb that does uniform damage to all mobs within a certain radius; (b) an ice-bomb that freezes all mobs within a certain radius; (c) a shrapnel bomb that does a massive amount of damage to a handful of mobs in a certain radius; and, my favorite, (d) a sword-swapping bomb that does their sword's amount of damage to every mob in a certain radius.\n\n(5) Explosives would be usable only in dungeons and only by archers. The last thing we need is to accidentally give mages another OP weapon that was originally intended for another class. \n\n(6) The explosives should be massively unbalanced when they first come out and then get nerfed a week later. (Kidding.)\n\nWhat do you think?"

    "body": "Recently my account has been hacked into, and whoever hacked into it likely ended up hacking inside of uhc champions, and got my account banned, seeing as I was in the uhc lobby when the ban was over. I don't blame watch dog for banning them, actually im rather glad that whoever was on my account couldn't do anything else on my main server. However, they ended up doing something much worse than changing my name and getting me banned. They basically stole all of my inventory inside of skyblock, which consisted of two sets of dragon armour (unstable and holy), both an aotd and aote, as well as around 300,000 coins from my bank, although not entirely sure why they'd steal that small amount. \n\n\n\nHere in this screenshot its easy to tell that im wearing some form of dragon armour (this was the holy set), and all of the weapons and tools are seen in the hotbar. However, when I logged on today after the ban was over, this is what my inventory looks like after I managed to get another aote\n\n\n\n\nAnd before someone says, what if you put all of your stuff in another chest? Well, first things first, I'm asking for help on if we could possibly find this group of people, or person. I want whoever this person is to get banned, going off of the fact they stole months of progress. Other thing is, I wouldn't create a post if I was looking for a refund on my items, and im pretty sure hypixel doesnt even do that.\nWhile I know it's not that much information to use, this is all i've gathered:\n\nWhoever managed to hack into my account did so on October 6, and played on it until the password was changed\nThis player is likely english speaking, but at the same time chinese speaking due to them having changed my language on the server.\nWhoever this person is, they changed my name from Asquidwithnoname to ModNMSL\nThis person plays on hypixel in some form or way, seeing as they stole all of my items as well as hacking inside of uhc champions (although I have no idea if they hacked in any other game)\nIf you have any idea on if this could be a specific player, or group of players please let me know.\nOne final thing, if you have seen the account ModNMSL, be it in either skyblock, or any other game, please let me know. And if said account hacked on you in any other gamemode, I appologize greatly for this. While I have no control over if someone uses a hack client inside of a game, I can appologize for their actions."

    "body": "Info:\nOver the last little while I have been farming a lot, and by a lot I am about to hit farming 46 (yes I know not even 50 lol). For the past months on my island I had had 4 layers of pumpkin and 2 1/2 layers of sugar cane and recently the interest of finding the difference in the most efficient crop became interesting to me. Now this was further amplified after the implementation of the blessed reforge for hoe's in Skyblock near the blacksmith merchant in the hub. For you I have simply done the math for you and will also add in a few things to \"note\" underneath the math as to help yourself when choosing which crop to chose. all finding were with a level 80 epic rabbit for those who cant get max lvl pets quickly meaning all xp gains can be increased by a total of 6% more xp with a level 100\n\nTools Used:\nSugarcane - Diamond Hoe (Blessed Reforge)\nPumpkins - Treecapitator\n\nSugar Cane Stats (260% speed)\nSugar cane 1 row: 2,357.6 xp\n\nSugar cane total rows on 1 layer = 55 x 2,357.6 = 129,668xp per layer\n\nsugar cane time per layer = 16 mins 30 secs\n\nSugar cane xp per minute = 129,668/16.5 = 7,858.6 xp\n\nSugar cane xp per hour = (60/16.5 = 3.6) = 129,668 x 3.6 = 466,804.8 xp\n\n\nPumpkin Stats (260% speed)\npumpkin 1 layer: 2,474.2 xp\n\nPumpkin total rows on 1 layer = 35 x 2,474.2 = 86,597 per layer\n\nPumpkin time per layer = 10min 31 seconds\n\nPumpkin xp per minute = 86,597/10.5 = 8,247.3 xp\n\nPumpkin xp per hour = (60/10.5 = 5.7) = 86,597 x 5.7 = 493,602.9\n\nTime for Farming 50: (Total xp required from lvl 0-50 = 55,172,425 xp)\n\nSugar Cane:\n118.1 Hours\n\n(With lvl 100 rabbit pet - 111.02 hours)\n\nPumpkin:\n111.7 Hours\n\n(With level 100 rabbit pet - 105.01 hours)\n\nDifference:\nThe difference in the 2 crops can be seen with pumpkin getting up to 26,798.1 xp more than sugar cane per hour therefore making it the most optimal crop to achieve farming 50 in the quickest time period\n\nPoints To Note:\n- Sugar cane will make a lot more money so if you need money and are willing to spend only 7 hours more farming then cane is 100% worth for you\n\n- In my test I had to theoretically find the total xp per hour on a layer basis, however if you actually want to achieve this level of efficiency for pumpkins you need 6 layers w/ water as that regrows 99.73% of the entire farm each run.\n\n- The speed percentages the runs were done at are not actually the most optimal but the most efficient if you will be doing both farms, as you can farm them consistently without missing any crops at 260% speed. Most optimal for pumpkin is 265% w/ good ping and cane is 261%.\n\n- All testing was conducted with the use of the lvl 80 rabbit, god potion (item) and cookie boost\n\nHope this helped you guys/girls out... Happy farming"

    "title": "Current Healer Items Suck - Read Before You Give Advice",
    "body": "I'm just making this so I can quote it whenever someone (who isn't a healer) tells me to use some stuff because it's \"good\". No big need to reply or react.\nTLDR: a lot of \"good\" items are not good.\n\nPETS\nThe healer class itself + the mender fedora gives OVERKILL healing. I can heal about 45% of my max health in ONE SECOND with just my circle and overflux.\n\nGhoul: It buffs what is already very strong. A strong pet, but completely unnecessary, which is why it is bad.\nAmplified Healing (+25% healing): You don't need +25% on something that can heal you to full in 2 seconds.\nZombie Arm (+50% range and healing to zombie sword): Zombie sword gives absolute garbage healing to other players (only ~70 hp base), while it can heal over half your max health at once to yourself- again, overkill.\nReaper Soul (+100% health/lifespan of reaper scythe zombies): Do I even need to explain? Reaper scythe was reworked and this ability currently does nothing.\n\nJellyfish: The healing/buffs it gives are negligible.\nRadiant Regeneration (+100% natural regeneration, +10hp/s to others): Double natural regeneration to yourself is unnecessary (because natural regeneration is weak). +10hp/s to others does nothing when \"others\" have 5k hp.\nHungry Healer (Enchanted Gapple effect given to nearby players every 10s for every 1000 hp you heal): The only relevant buffs are 5 defense and 80 absorption. The stats are too little to do anything.\nPowerful Potions (+100% effectiveness of healing/mana pots): Splash potions are useless in dungeons. You can only use one, anyway.\n\nGriffin: I haven't used this, but the way the healing mechanic works doesn't seem to great. Also, the healer class's base healing is enough healing already.\nOdyssey (Mythology): Not used for dungeons.\nLegendary Constitution (Regen 7, Strength 8): Good for damage, although not for healing.\nPerpetual Empathy (Heal others for 20% damage you receive): You must take damage, meaning you must use jingle bells, which drains your mana fast. Jingle bells also do not take boss agro for long.\nKing of Kings (+15% strength when above 85% hp): Good for damage, although not for healing.\n\nSo healers are forced to use damage/tank pets.\n\n\nWEAPONS\nThere are only 3 that can somewhat be used for healer. Two are garbage and the last one doesn't even work.\n\nAdaptive Blade: Just bad.\nDamage: Terrible base stats.\n+5 hp/s to allies: Negligible healing. Even worse than jellyfish.\n+20% hp regen: Natural regen is too weak.\n\nFlorid Zombie Sword: Unnecessary.\nDamage: It's not a damage weapon.\nIncreased healing over ornate: Zombie swords aren't meant for healing to other players, and that tiny increase in healing to yourself won't do anything.\n2 extra charges: If you ever end up relying on those to survive, you're dead once they run out.\n\nFel Sword: Too bugged to work, but good damage. Very cheap, so that's a plus, but it doesn't do what it's supposed to do.\nDamage: Exceptional, it is better than a 50 mil Midas when maxed.\n-10s wish cool down: Bugged and doesn't even work. I tested.\n+10% healing circle healing: Would be good, but is bugged. I tested.\n\n\nARMOR\nThe healing helmets are pretty powerful. But they do make healer more than 25% armor-locked, because helmets have the most powerful abilities of all armor pieces.\n\nMender Helmet: Outclassed by zombie heart.\nZombie heart doubles all regeneration to yourself as well (instead of just healing to teammates), at the cost of only -30 hp.\n\nMender Fedora: Good item. Only one complaint.\nIt does not double healing given to yourself by other players. Only doubles healing given to yourself by yourself.\n\n\nUTILITY ITEMS\nPlasmaflux Power Orb: Few complaints. Good item but extremely overpriced for the tiny stat increases it provides. Read this thread for an in-depth comparison.\n\nOverflux Power Orb: No complaints. Good item and the price dropped recently.\n\nMana Flux Power Orb: No complaints. Good item, almost on-par with overflux, and very cheap.\n\nRadiant Power Orb: No healer should ever be using this, but it's decent I guess.\n\nLesser Orb of Healing: Massive mana drain. Only useful for mage healers. Also doesn't even work in dungeons.\n50 mana/second is HUGE. And it only heals 5% of the target's max hp, which is tiny compared to what healing circle + aura does (healing circle + aura also has 0 mana cost).\nYou can't even put ultimate wise on it.\nFor comparison:\nI can heal someone from 0 to full in 4-5 seconds with a healing circle + aura, for 0 mana.\nWith this orb, I would need the same time (because healer class buffs + helmet), but 200-250 mana.\n\n\nREFORGES\nEmpowered (Titanic with +10% healing): Good reforge, but again- like ghoul, just unnecessary.\nYou don't need a +10% on a combo that heals people to full in 2 seconds.\n\n\n\nWhat do healers need? Some more support items that shield others, because we have more than enough healing."

Village Affinity Artifact: Allows you to spend $$$ directly from your bank on the ah, while in the auction house, gives buff from village affinity ring, gives +100% speed while in the Village.\n\n- Reforge Bag: Allows you to reforge multiple items at once, costing the cumulative amount of all of the items. When using Accessories, gives the discount present in the Accessory Bag on all of the accessories in the bag. Can hold a double chest full of items, but only reforgable items can be held in it and no player may have more than 1 in his/her inventory.\n\n- Piggy bank patch: (costs 8 enchanted pork): when right-clicked, repair the active piggy bank in your inv by 1.\n\n- Wardrobe totem: Left-Click: switches the current set you are wearing one to the right, and does not work if you aren't wearing a set. Right-Click: opens the wardrobe menu.\n\nCleaning stone - costs $500 from the guy who sells all those reforge stones, and is free to apply. Removes all of the items enchantments and anvil uses, as well as refunds any fuming potato books used on the item (or it just deletes em but I feel like that is too expensive/mean)\n\n(not an item but) Sac of sacs settings: allow you to disable items going into your sacs, withdraw/deposit all items from and into sacs, and has a setting where all items coming from minions do not go into sacs.\n\nPlease tell me what you think in the comments!"

It can be used by berserker and tank as a stand-in healer and the effectiveness does increase when multiple teammates are running it but only during boss fights such F5 and F6 (terracottas). One upside to all this if you still manage to die while being burst healed, you only have yourself to blame soo gg healers another \"don't blame me\" free pass"

So without further a due, I have made a guide to help you place and get these drops:\n\nPreparing\nPotions: Potions are great for dealing damage, as they provide significant boosts to your damage and other stats. Also if you have low skills or not many talismans, they can help make up for that, but I would really recommend having good talismans with good reforges such as itchy, strong, and godly\n\nCrit iv(Crit chance is most helpful here)\nPet luck iv\nstrength viii\nadrenaline(gives speed and absorption so you don't die)\nSpirit iv(Speed and crit damage are helpful)\nArmor: Try something with a lot of strength as strength is very useful, tarantula is good for the full set ability, as is 3/4 strong and tara helm, or superior if you can afford it. Make sure your armor is reforged to strong or godly for maximum damage\nWeapon: Aotd works fine, midas and yeti are good if you can afford too. Make sure you have crit vi, as it is somewhat cheap and is useful. Never forget hpbs as without them, your damage is significantly reduced\nPets: I personally use the phoenix because with the fourth flair ability I can easily place the high amount of strength is also useful, dragon pet obviously works, as does tiger and lion, enderman is not so good, so I would recommend a different pet.\n\nStrategy\nTry to get the protector to go towards the back of the alter, then getting up at about the level it's head it at so it can't hit you and your hits can't be blocked by others, and hit as much as you can. I also find the phoenix fourth flair ability helps a good deal, with my crit, I can place first by just 1 hit with the ability lol- thats 300-700k with the ability, my crit is 20-70k depending on weapon, armor, talismans, and stuff. Also make sure you aim for the protectors chest/torso it nearly always registers your hit if you it it there also make sure you shift while fighting it, I find that it helps for some reason. Also make sure you get at least 100 zealot kills so you can get good loot. And don't forget your pots. Make sure you do not die as this can set you back hundreds of thousands of damage, to prevent dying, try to carry an ornate zombie sword with you.\n\nGood rewards\nThings that the endstone protector drops that are very good include the tier boost core and the golem pet. Both sell for high amounts, I would recommend selling them over using them. To get good rewards you must kill a high amount of zealots contributing to spawning the boss, 100 is best if you can.\n\nAbout me\nSo I have made a large fortune from endstone protectors, my most notable moment is when I received 3 tier boost cores in a row, this made me a ton of money, so rather than grinding zealots for eyes, grind them for good rewards for endstone protectors. I have low skill levels and I only have about 40 talismans, but my strategy makes up for those losses, therefore make sure you focus on your strategy more than anything as it helps the most.\n\nHope this helps you next time you fight an endstone protector, \n\nGood luck,\nSwap_MC"

    "title": "[Guide] How to avoid scammers of all types",
    "body": "I have seen many posts about people getting scammed in skyblock, and I personally have been scammed a couple times. To help you not to be scammed I have created this thread in hopes to inform you of the most popular scams out there in skyblock to prevent it from happening to you. Here are some of the most popular scams:\n\n1. Coop scam\n-You add someone who seems nice to your island for help, for instance you need help making a pumpkin farm, and they kick you or steal your stuff. \nOne way you can combat this is to either do it yourself even though it will take some time, you can invite a friend you know in real life or somebody you really trust and know they won't try to harm you. Avoid players you have just met or met only on hypixel.\n\n-You add someone to you skyblock island because you want to make a coop and they end up stealing your stuff or kicking you.\nTo combat this scam you can use the same tactics as the first I listed.\n\n-Griefing- A player in you coop gets mad or wants to make you upset so they ruin your island/account by throwing stuff in the void, giving away stuff or just blowing things up. \nThis is very hard to defend against. Precautions you can take are things like keeping your valuables on you or making sure this 'friend' who is your coop is really reliable. Don't just take their word for it, if you don't know them and get scammed, it's YOUR fault.\n\n\n\n2. Item/trade scam\n-You are trading for an item but what they claim to have given you isn't what it seemed or they switch the item right before you accept the trade.\nTo prevent this from happening, always check the trade, make sure they are giving you what they say, if not, cancel the trade immediately, sometimes you may get them to actually trade the second time, but other times, they will try and scam you again. Be prepared for this and never trade all your stuff without a backup to get you started again if you lose all your stuff.\n\n-You are trading but do not know the value of your item(s)/the other person's item(s) \nTo make sure this doesn't happen, always check the auction house or bazaar for the item you are trading and look at ending soon to see how much the item commonly goes for or ask your guild/friends, it might actually be more profitable to sell the item elsewhere, so always take that time to look.\n\n-The backpack scam- one of the most common scams in the hubs. \nThere are two ways I know of for combating this. You can try installing a texture pack/mod(https://hypixel.net/threads/forge-1...view-your-skyblock-backpack-contents.2198897/) to see items inside backpacks, or you can refuse to buy items in the backpack and say you want to be able to see the items you are trading for not in the backpack. Never trade for a backpack unless you know for sure what's in it. It's always ok to refuse to trade.\n\n-New player scam- Someone claims to be a new player and asks for items or money. \nGenerally you should just ignore this if you aren't sure. If you know that they are actually new, only give them items that can help them but won't cost you too much such as lapis or miner armor. Also if someone is asking for stuff this probably means they actually know what they are doing so don't necessarily give them stuff. If you want to help new players, look for people on the hub island wearing lapis or something, you can also check the gold mines and the deep caverns to help someone because often end/midgame players don't spend much time in the mines.\n\n\nI would love to hear what you think.  If you come across anymore scams or have any edits or advice you would like added, comment below, thanks for reading this, I hope it helps you."

    "title": "New farming update leaks and my thoughts!",
    "body": "So, Minikloon just released a new farming update video showing many new utility items you can use while building and planting farms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video shows many different items:\nInfinidirt wand: Allows you to place dirt for 2 coins on your private island, and seems to have a pretty big range that you can place the blocks in.\nPrismapump: pumps water that is poured around it, seen filling up a decent length of 1 block wide ditches.\nHoe of great tilling: tills a 5x5 area of dirt, works around water and anything else\nBasket of seeds: instantly place down a row of seeds or crops, seen covering a big distance and working with wet and dry farmland. Stores seeds just like the builder wand\n\nAnd.... that's it. Honestly, I wasn't impressed. Let's talk about each of these items and potential problems they may have.\n\nThe first item is the infinidirt wand, and my main problem with this is that it is basically useless. You can buy dirt from the builder for the same price, place one, and then use the builders wand to place infinite of it as long as it is in the inventory. It would be nice if it were to place, say a 5x5 area of dirt if you upgrade it or something, but at it's current state I see this to be a pretty useless or maybe optional item.\nThe next is Prismapump, and I LOVE THE PRISMAPUMP!!! It gives some use to prismarine, makes the grueling task of placing water easier, and is a very good item. I do hope that this is reusable, and I hope it can go the whole 160 blocks of the island. Other than that, this is pretty nice and I do hope that if it isn't reusable that it isn't that expensive.\nNow, the hoe of great tilling. I love the hoe of great tilling, and I have no problem with it.\nThe last is the Basket of seeds, and the main problem with this is that it might replace replenish. I feel with potato and carrot farming, you could farm a row, and then turn back and place with the basket of seed. I feel that this would make replenish decently bad, since it is expensive and their may be a cheaper alternative.\n\nTis tis all for now, and just like the last leak, I feel these have a lot of things that need to be changed before the update is fully released."

    "body": "The colosseum in skyblock hasn't been getting many updates/leaks/anything tbh, I think there needs to be some sort of pvp thing.\n\nIdea 1: Betting\n\nPeople can bet coins, say I bet 500k that I'll win a duel (could apply to items, too) against some guy, and he accepts. You get a standard classic duel kit, but with a few twists, like maybe a magic tool instead of a bow that shoots a laser than does 2 hearts, and instead of a rod it could be a snowball launcher from Jerry Event. Whoever wins the duel gets 500k from the opponent. This can be good for people that are just starting out, or end game players who just wanna risk it all. It won't be too big of an economy crash because you can only bet what you have, and you probably only should be able to 1v1 once or twice a day, because if you could do it infinitely it'll break everything.\n\nIdea 2: Tournaments\n\nLike the bedwars tournament or the Blitz tournament, players will participate in a Colosseum tournament. Everyone has standard items as stated above, and the higher of a placement you get, the more items you get. Players will compete to get limited items and prizes that only will exist once there. There is a specific mayor called \"Sparter\" that makes a 24 hour long tournament for the skyblock players to compete in, and is a very rare mayor like Scorpius. If you place in the top 5 thousand, you win 500k coins, a cosmetic trophy, and a set of Chariot Armor, and the buffs of Chariot Armor are:\n\n+25 crit damage for each armor piece, +150 hp, 100 defense, and 10 speed. Everything gets buffed twice as much when riding on an animal.\n\nIf you are top 1 thousand, you earn 750k coins and a talisman called Spartan Artifact, being a legendary talisman, and it's ability is: \"When killing a mob, gain 2 strength for 5 seconds. This will stack up to 50.\"\n\nIf top 500, gain 1m coins and a special staff called \"Spartan Cannon\", which stats are:\n\n+200 dmg\n+100 str\n+50 crit damage\n\nItem ability: When you left click, shoots a cannon ball that does 10,000 magic damage.\n\nIf top 100, gain 5m coins and an enchant called \"Conqueror's Sight V\" which can be applied to the helmet, and multiplies the effects of all swords by 1.2.\n\nIf top 10, gain the reforge stone known as \"Spartan Sapphire\" and earn 10m coins. The stone buffs swords by giving 100 damage and 100 strength, making it the best reforge.\n\nIf top player, gain the sword called \"Sword of the Spartans\" and 40m coins, and the sword does 400 damage and 300 strength, completely outranking everything else. This player also gets a special name tag called \"I AM SPARTA\" on the side of their name in tab.\n\nI'll add more ideas if I think of any, thanks for reading, and also, I don't have photoshop or anything like that so I can't make pictures demonstrating the items."

So i have thought of a couple of ideas that might make dragons more entertaining.\n1: dragon hunter armor:\nthis could be a new drop that dragons can give you(instead of the aotd or reforge stone)\nit would give you some strength and crit damage, as well as making you double jump. It would also add 75 base damage to the \nDragon hunter sword:\nthis would be a sword around about as strong as an aotd, but it would deal extra damage to dragons, and it also would have an ability that would make you deal double the damage on the third hit.\nI also thought it might be cool to have dragons be able to drop a dragon egg, that you can place on your island.\na dragon egg would give you the stat that the armor would give you (unstable crit chance, strong gives strength etc)\nas well as making dragons stronger. make every end crystal heal them 1million health IF the crystal stays alive for 5 seconds. and make the attacks stronger.\nalso make dragons immune to ferocity and make damaging pots worthless against them\nThese are just some examples of what i think could make dragons more interesting. Some of these might be to overpowered or underpowered, so if you see something that should be different, please tell me. (Also sorry for my bad English)\nStay save everyone"

Today i was farming wheat in the main hub when someone by the name of Turim said in chat to add them to a coop because they were quitting skyblock and were giving away endgame items. Of course, if you played for long enough, you know were this is going. I added them and in the next 5 seconds i lost everything. All my skills, items, my entire island was gone, im back to square one. If there is anyway i can get him banned or if there is somehow a way i could get my stuff back, id greatly appreciate it.\n\nThank you for your time"

    "title": "Dungeon Classes as Avengers (and a little Umbrella Academy)",
    "body": "The other day I realized that mages were a lot like Ironman, and that got me thinking...each dungeon class is a lot like one of the Avengers. To wit:\n\nMAGES are like Ironman. Their play style depends on using the most expensive gadgets to beat the bad guys. They're sometimes prone to arrogance, but at the end of the day you're really glad to have them on your side.\n\nTANKS are like Professor Hulk. They are basically indestructible, though they don't do as much damage as they would if they let themselves go berserk (that is, be like regular Hulk). In my experience, they tend to be the most thoughtful, introspective players. (As evidence of this, see the really good recent post in which a tank analyzes their class's problems and makes a plea for them to be solved.)\n\nHEALERS are like Vision/Jarvis. They are the smartest class, in my estimation, since they are always juggling several variables in order to determine how to maximize their team's chances of success. They are also the most selfless class, in a non-showy way.\n\nARCHERS are like Hawkeye (duh), but that's a little too on-the-nose. So I'll say that they are like the Winter Soldier--highly skilled assassins who can take out any target. (Side note: SkyBlock should add more explosives to archers' bag of tricks--they can set up explosives and then stand on a ledge somewhere with a detonator. How fun would that be?! SkyBlock, make this happen!)\n\nFinally, BERSERKERS are like Captain America (if they use the Flower of Truth=Cap's shield), Black Panther (if they use Livid Dagger=attack speed!), or regular Hulk (if they use Giant's Sword). In general, they're probably closest to Captain America, since they're good at dealing with loads of lower-powered bad guys but need a team to beat the big bosses. And they tend to feel a sort of rivalry with Ironman/mages!\n\nI guess I'm a little bored. And I miss the MCU. Come back soon, world!\n\nP.S. The Umbrella Academy only works for certain classes: Tanks are Luther, Archers are Diego, and Healers are Five. I don't see a good parallel for Mages or Berserkers, though some mages think they're Vanya..."

    "title": "iDobie's Side of The Story.",
    "body": "Please read with an unbiased perspective. (copied from IDobie's dm with me).\n\nThe Story:\nIt all started off like this, I met this guy in game, and he wanted to damage test my Aspect Of The End, so, or a bit more safety, I ask for his discord, and eventually find out he is a ThirtyVirus YouTube Member, (as of recently his rank on the discord server was removed, and he was warned. He has not been banned or kicked.)\nFor any of his supporters, keep on supporting him if you want, but this video might change your mind, for anyone supporting me, again it's your decision. No matter what side you are on, both of us were in the wrong as you\u2019ll find out, and as to why we were wrong. I am not gonna paint a picture, where I am perfect and and he is the absolute villain because that wouldn't be the truth. Somebody already did that. I had made a forum post on hypixel, and it got removed for public shaming, as of what I know the guy got no punishment whatsoever.\n\nWednesday (Eastern Time):\nBack to the story. Around about noon, I meet this guy in-game, and he wants to damage test my Aspect Of The End, so I ask for his discord, and eventually find out he is a Thirty Virus YouTube Member. So I thought he was credible. His In-Game Name was 1Point17. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768419022604992532/769218588815917066/unknown.png His discord username is Sleeting. I won\u2019t include his tag because that would be a violation of his privacy, and I don\u2019t want to cause that problem. Because he was a Thirty Virus YouTube member, I thought that he was credible and trustworthy. (later he lost his role, possibly because maybe he ran out of youtube member sub, disconnected, hid/changed his YouTube account) So I let him damage test it. Then he scams me. He forgot to block, or ignore add me, and about 30 minutes later I scammed him out of his old Aspect Of The End, using the Old Damage Test Method. I shouldn\u2019t have scammed this guy, especially over an aspect of the end, but I was mad at him, mainly because that week I got scammed out of a Level 100 Legendary Enderman, A somewhat high level epic griffin and more, it was my fault that I got scammed, but that didn\u2019t stop me from being mad about it. I shouldn\u2019t have done it, and if I will take full responsibility for my actions and accept any punishment I get. So anyways, after I scammed him, I got banned from the Thirty Virus discord because he starts talking about it in one of the channels on the server. I was also muted and therefore couldn\u2019t defend myself. He was bragging about it saying that he scammed me and was justifying it because I scammed him back. A couple people I never met started defending me. I have no idea why, but if you are watching this, thank you. At least one of them was a very credible person. https://media.discordapp.net/attach...3640649441300/image0.png?width=267&height=475\nLater one of his friends Private messages me in discord repeating the same thing over and over, SCAMMING ***** *****.\nThis was the one of the first attacks, and surprisingly also not the worst of it, everything else is oh so much worse. https://media.discordapp.net/attach...573013565440/unknown.png?width=891&height=475\nI reported it to a Thirty Admin as soon as I could, but I mainly had to do it through Vjay(The credible person who defended me) and they reported the guy who said it. The person was banned for a week. Later that evening ProNinjaGamin0, who had banned me, and had banned the other guy, joined my discord server, (which you should totally join, link in the description). I am not upset at him, as he was doing his job, and, with the information that he was given, it looked like I had been the one scamming. I assume he joined to investigate, but I was not afraid of that as I have nothing to hide.I asked around to see if there was anything I was forgetting but I think I covered all the important stuff from wednesday.\n\nThursday (Eastern Time)\nI wake up to a death threat. I couldn\u2019t even take a screenshot, as it got deleted. I don\u2019t even remember who it was, and I have no way of checking, so you\u2019ll just have to take my word for it. I immediately thought about what happened on Wednesday. And thought about sleeting, and I knew he was behind this somehow. Fast forward a little (Context to this next little bit, he has a youtube channel and he has been posting in quotations \u201cproof\u201d) He made a video, about this death threat thing, and said that it's ****ed up and he would never do it. And my response to it was \u201cI literally have proof of those death threats, which I am not releasing yet. I don't know if you sent someone after me or not, but it still exists. And you are right it's ****ed up, even though I have no evidence that it's you, there is one thing in common between most of them, they know you, through a discord server, they are friends with you, or are subscribed to you.\u201d\nI currently can\u2019t tie them to him, but again most of these people are close friends of his.\nLet\u2019s go back to the timeline. I log onto a hypixel skyblock, collect minions, grind a little, and get on to my classes. Everything is fine until sleeting tries to contact me. I had blocked him, and just focused on my school work. Fast forward to school is done and I do some homework and I get onto hypixel, and I get partied and warped to an island. The owner of the island is muted so he puts down a couple signs. https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net...mcBrNLuzKzYo6JxSF3QB.png?width=920&height=475\nHe tells me to go committ suicide, and later a sign saying (Which I don\u2019t have a screenshot of), if you don\u2019t commit suicide, I will come after you my self. Like what the hell? It had some kind of creepy, stalker vibe. I shared it with a close friend ShadeSoul, and he suggested I make a forum post, meanwhile my video editor suggested I don\u2019t, but I had already made the post. I was expecting people to be really negative about it, but I was surprised at the support I was getting. There were people that were like oh that's a **** post.However, a lot of people were also like, \u201cWhy are you making a post about getting scammed out of an Aspect Of The End\u201d. And my video editor responded and gave a very good point. He said that the problem isn\u2019t the fact that I got scammed, the problem is that I am getting death threats, being bullied, and being told to go commit suicide. My video editor, Sooubway was threatened by the guy himself, because of his response. https://media.discordapp.net/attach...4089129295882/image0.png?width=267&height=475\nHe said that because I deleted my forum post, it proved that I lied, and my response was, \u201cno an admin deleted it, because of the public shaming rule, I even reposted it just without names.\u201d\nHere are some more dms.\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachme...9208/Screen_Shot_2020-10-23_at_9.00.04_AM.png\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachme...5488/Screen_Shot_2020-10-23_at_9.01.04_AM.png\n\nI found out later that a piece of his evidence is the fact that I use badlion.\nHe and a friend by the name of Quaglet, both in discord and in game, partied me on Hypixel and proceeded to bully me. I said before they did anything, \u201cI will give you 1 minute to say anything that you feel like saying, as I am about to go to bed.\u201d Long story short I stayed for about 5 minutes extra as they bullied me. I immediately left, and went to bed. Later on Friday around noon Sleeting partied me and said that I was avoiding him, and using going to bed as an excuse, while it was 10pm for me and it usually takes me an hour to fall asleep. Plus on top of the fact that I was stressed because of recent events, and I was falling behind on school work. So it might\u2019ve taken me 1-2 hours to fall asleep. I fell asleep around 11-11:30pm.\n\nFriday (Eastern Time):\nI got up early. I saw that my forum post was deleted by an admin, and I reposted just without the \u201cpublic shaming\u201dNothing yet, except for the fact as I was afk on my skyblock island. Nothing unusual, but I scrolled up in chat a little bit and he tried to party me. Later on Friday he joins my island, and says he has all this evidence(Which includes his \u201cevidence\u201d that I play on badlion\u201d). He acted really mad, and I got partied by him, where he said that I am having a breakdown.\nHe had also said that he never threatened me in all caps, which only made me believe that he was even more mad.\nhttps://media.discordapp.net/attach...591197724692/unknown.png?width=891&height=475\n\nHe said that I deleted Direct messages between him and me, and to be honest I did delete some. Basically I deleted the direct messages related to the video he uploaded, which included me scamming him out of the Aspect of the end, after I got scammed. I deleted them because he was making in quotations \u201cproof\u201d videos, including anything he could, on top of encouraging people to bully me.\n\nTuesday EST:\n\nI wake up and decide to check forums. All of a sudden people are hating on me and are calling me a scammer. I am very confused and ask questions as to what's happening. Someone gives me a link (They want to stay anonymous.) and i read it. I think to myself this is ludicrous. The situation that they brought up was me talking to this guy and asking to borrow a legendary wolf, and some superior armor. Afterwards there was an image of me selling superior armor and a legendary wolf. I admit that is very suspicious, and there is a reason for it looking that way. But what I did in order to be able to afford things such as the midas staff I sold a lot of my items, and I flipped superior multiple times, not to mention a lot of grinding. In the end how is that scamming? Than some other people wanted me to give him the sup armor and leg wolf. I was so confused as to what was happening. I got messages from people like \u201cyou deserved those death threats.\u201d Someone even created an alt called \u201ciDobieHater.\u201d https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/712246198177628181/770679187878969354/unknown.png\nSome other people said that I now am hated even more than ThirtyVirus. First that's an insult to ThirtyVirus. And second, I don\u2019t think ThirtyVirus was hated. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/712246198177628181/770705737940598864/unknown.png\nPeople think that it is funny, and anyone who comes up with a story gets a mass amount of praise. Any negative comment towards me is met with praise. Any one who supports me has gotten death threats, bullying and more.\n\n\nMore Information on Sleeting:\n\nSleeting has a track record himself, and actually has some other things that might be good to take into account. He has been ban evading, his main account Sleeting got banned on Hypixel (reason unknown) and he started the account 1Point17 as an alt. He has made threats that aren't as violent as some of the ones I have gotten, but are still pretty bad. Even if he didn\u2019t make a death threat himself, his friends did, and when I mentioned that it was his friends that made the death threats, he said \u201csure, as if.\u201d and said that it wasn\u2019t true. I think he might be defending his friends, because if he admitted it, he would immediately be in the wrong and lose this \u201cargument\u201d.\nhttps://media.discordapp.net/attach...925734641695/unknown.png?width=891&height=475\nHe could have faked evidence.\n\n\n\nIn Summary:\nSo, to put it into wraps, over these last few days I have received both a lot of support and a lot of backlash about this situation. In the end, both sides have their points and opinions. Neither side has admitted to being wrong, so I can\u2019t tell you for sure who is at fault. What I can tell you though is that through all of this evidence that you\u2019re seeing here, why would these people get so upset over something so trivial? To me, the only reason this really became a problem is because of the large stack of lies and inconsistencies that came with it.\n\nI don\u2019t have a problem with the money. Losing that Aspect of the End and the 150k is not fun, but it isn\u2019t the end of the world. In the end the problem is the way that I was treated as a result of these people going too far.\n\nConclusion:\nBut yeah, that\u2019s about it. Thank you for watching and taking the time to listen to my side. You are free to have your own opinion, just try to take into account the things that have transpired, and make decisions off of that, not mine nor Sleetings word.\n\nDon\u2019t go and put hate towards this guy, I know some of you might want to, but please don\u2019t. It won\u2019t help me, or anyone in the long run. What I suggest doing is ignoring this guy, or just not getting involved in general. He just wants attention. And we don\u2019t give him what he wants, especially not in this situation.If anything else happens, I will put it in the description. If it is anything big, then I most likely will just make a whole other video about it.\n\n\nIt was gonna be for a video"

Forced into the dark arts of necromancy by his parents at 14. He found it fascinating that he could resurrect the dead corpses and make them do what he wants. He came under Necron's command around the age of 15 and made into one of his weaker generals by the age of 17. Bonzo got an order from Necron on his 18th birthday.\n\nBonzo just got orders that he needs to return to Necron because a human escaped from the catacombs. It took a while to get to the lowest floor but he got there in due time. Apparently Scarf was having a bit of fun with the adventurers now, because Bonzo was not there to clown on the poor adventurers. Scarf danced with them and killed them easily. \n\nBut the adventurers also managed to get loot from the first floor and then sold it to their friends after they escaped using the new gear. Bonzo's training at the Necromancer Academy was cut short because the adventurers were making it to Scarf constantly now, so Bonzo must return. Unfortunately for Bonzo the loot from his floor and Scarf's floor made it nearly impossible to beat the adventurers, so he kept getting beaten by nearly everyone. \n\nEventually, Bonzo figured out how to revive himself nearly instantly, and so he could compete with the weaker humans. Necron was happy that Bonzo found out how to revive himself like the adventurers could, and then decided that they could learn just a little from the humans. Necron then told Scarf that he must use his next set of adventurers as minions because they could be stronger than regular undeads. Bonzo was happy that he did something that got Necron's approval, and then was used to make his commander, Scarf, also do something with the humans.\n\nThank you for reading this, I hope you enjoyed it! Make sure to leave a like if you liked it as it motivates me to make more! Part 3 of Scarf should be out in a few days and within the end of the year the megathread (Hopefully). I will link it when it is done right here --->\n\nEdit 1: Formatting"

If you want to add more enchants and dont know howto just ask and I'll try my best.

    "body": "So basically a lot of people have been talking about the bazaar and how to calculate the best minions, and people are saying that gold and lapis are the best minions atm, but really, snow should be the meta. \n\nIf you do the math (Math warning):\n\nIt costs 318k to upgrade a snow minion from tier 1 to tier 11 if you buy enchanted snow blocks which go for 608 atm on bazaar and are comprised of 600 snow, or if you use snow produced by snow minions which sell for 1 coin each.\n\nIll say that it costs the rest of the coins to 400k to get a snow minion tier 1 since they drop at ok rates from common, green, and red gifts (I've heard that green gifts are the best)\n\nAn enchanted lava bucket costs about 400k to buy from the bazaar. (if you buy ench coal blocks and ench iron and either craft the lava bucket or get someone on skyblockZ to craft it you can save around 40k per enchanted lava bucket)\n\nAnd a super compactor 3000 costs about 400k from the bazaar.\n\nIf we combine all of these values together then that means that a T11 snow minion costs approximately 1.2 million dollars (not including diamond spreading and medium storage because those are very cheap)\n\nA T11 snow minion with an enchanted lava bucket makes, (I used TBlazeWarriorT's minion spreadsheet (very useful by the way (also I'm nesting parentheses epic))) around 59k coins per day selling to the NPC's at spawn. I'm going to round that up to 60k because the bazaar prices are slightly higher than the NPC prices for diamonds and snow (especially if you create a buy order instead of insta-selling)\n\nThis means that after buying a snow minion for 1.2 million coins, you will make 60k per day FROM 1 MINION. This should pay off in about 20 days, and then your making pure profit. This is extremely good because most other tier 11 minions pay off in months.\n\nNow on to why snow minions are better than other minions that make more money on the bazaar.\n\n1. As shown above, snow minions are easy to get to T11 and pay off very quickly.\n2. If you go with the volatile market of the bazaar, you will spend half of your time playing skyblock constantly changing your minions and buying materials to level up the minion that makes the most money currently, but when everyone catches on then you will have to change minions and start the process over and over again, ultimately reducing your minion profits or maybe even losing money leveling up so many minions.\n3. With a snow minion, it will take about 20 days to fill up with a super compactor, diamond spreading, and enchanted lava bucket so you don't have to worry about storage filling up. Don't worry if your snow minion seems to not be compacting snow into enchanted snow blocks, it takes almost 10 stacks of snow to make 1 enchanted snow blocks.\n\nthank for listen to ted talk yes"

However, certain youtuber(s), haven\u2019t been giving good or accurate data.\n\nNot gonna start a war like earlier but @Toadstar0 stated in his latest video of werewolf armor that the set is amazing for tanking and can help you survive as it heals you every time you deal damage. And he said this set is 100 recommended for F7.\n\nFirst off, that is wrong. The set ability doesn\u2019t ever say it heals you. It only heals other around you. Also, from people testing and telling me, it never healed them. (Had to make sure they weren\u2019t berserkers as they do get bloodlust which heals them). When toad was doing testing, he was doing it as a tank. And we all no, tanks don\u2019t die. (Unless really bad).\n\nSo, just to make this short without bringing old topics of when he didn\u2019t state accurate info, youtubers really gotta investigate and proof read stuff. Cause, ngl, there are a bunch of sweaty 9 year olds who now think that they made a mistake and then go quickly to buy werewolf set only to see it isn\u2019t as great, this set only good for healers, that\u2019s all IMO.(after this big incident, I wanted to watch his videos to see if @rm_rf_slash was right. And, they were). So, in conclusion, If youtubers gonna give advice or good guides, they better make sure it\u2019s accurate at least"

The saw motor can be obtained as a crazy rare drop (7/13000) from dungeon mobs in floor 4 or up. The sawblade can be crafted from 4 chains and a scythe blade. A chain can be obtained by putting fire in a crafting table. Fire can be obtained by mining fire with a silk touch pickaxe. The chainsaw does 200 damage, making it pretty useless, but it's ability is what is powerful. It's ability can be used when you right click while very close to a monster. The chainsaw will rev up, and lock the enemy and you in place. You then have 3 seconds to saw through the enemy, and you can spam click for insane damage. With a consistent cps of 10, you could deal up to 6,000 base damage, not including crit damage or crit chance. The problem is, you can get damaged by other mobs when doing this. It has a 20 second cooldown and can be used on any enemy. This can also be used to cut down trees, and using it's ability on a tree activates a 1 second animation where you cut through the tree, and the whole tree gets cut down."

It's full set bonus is: True - Convert 1% base damage into true damage, and convert 1% defense into true defense. It has a leveling system similar to perfect armor, with a maximum of 9 upgrades. Each upgrade costs 16 stacks of Enchanted Iron Blocks, and gives 1% conversion. Additionally, with the True Enchantment, which is an ultimate enchantment dropped by Awakened Golems (mythological creature with 100,000,000 health, but half dps of default inquisitor), you can make it 30% stats. The problem is, Awakened Golems are one of the rarest creature to dig up, requiring a legendary griffin and being almost as rare as inquisitors, and only having a 25% chance to drop the book. The book converts 1% damage and defense to true damage and true defense per level, and if you apply True V to every piece of armor you have, you will have 30% converted. This can be crazy for campfires, dragons, svens, or anything that deals with true damage or defense. The only problem is, a full True V set would cost over 2 billion coins."

People have been conditioned to special items, such as the crab hat, and assume that they will inevitably go up in value. This leads to everyone and their mother looking to buy century cakes. Now one day, these investors will realize \"oh crap, the cakes aren't going up, I better cut my losses and sell\" This leads the price to drop little by little, and oh, everyone is doing, and you have the price plummet. Now this might not happen if there is a buff that could give some consistent value to some of the cakes, which would then balance the inevitable crash and keep a consistent price. already today these prices have fallen SIGNIFICANTLY so its only going downhill from here. So if you think your being 5Head and investing in these new kewl items, sell now and make it so your not poor. NOW THERE IS A POSSIBILITY I AM WRONG, THIS IS ONLY A SUGGESTION. But this is my genuine belief, so whether or not you act on what I just told you is your call, and i wont pressure you further. Now I kinda know how these work a lil bit, because I was one of if the THE pioneer of the \"BuYiNg CrYsTaL fRaGs fOr 2Ok a PeIcE\" and i made millions off that until over usage, so I know over usage when I see it, so I suggest believing me, but again, your call\n\nThis was my TED TALK, I will reply to any questions. This is hopefully the start of my reputation on the forums, I haven't been really active on them.\n\nTL;DR- SELL YOUR CAKES BRUV (or don't idc)"

    "body": "Hi, I'm relatively new to Skyblock and got scammed by an MVP+ saying that they would help me build on my island. I had only ever heard good things about the Skyblock community so I decided to trust him. This was my first mistake. He ended up destroying my island and killing me multiple times with TNT and lava. I am now in a Co-Op with him and don't want to rebuild if he's able to just come back and destroy it all again. I have looked for a way for me to leave to Co-Op but couldn't find one so I was wondering if there was a way to leave and if so how?"

    "title": "City Project: Dungeon Headquarters - Idea",
    "body": "Currently as the city projects are close to completion and starting the build process, soon we will need new city projects. One part of Skyblock I think is somewhat lacking is the catacombs hub. No not the dungeons hub, the small area in the crypts. I feel like its fallen out of use and honestly doesn't seem as great anymore, so what if we revamped this area?\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Part 1 - Structure/New Building:\n\n\n\nThe revamped Catacombs headquarters would not only now have a new entrance more directly from the hub, most likely around the coal mine area. But now the main area would have huge changes, firstly now Ophelia has been moved to a separate small shop room. A new small blacksmithing area as well which would both be in a hall on the left side of the main dungeon door. The dungeon door with Mort still stands. Then it would also feature a hallway containing some new rooms as well, mainly a planning room with a map of a dungeon. Then room 2 would be chest and loot storage behind a huge iron reinforced wood door containing the loots of many runs. Room 3 would be a small library with special books and enchantments scattered throughout. Room 4 containing essences and powerful weapons to be studied. Finally Room 5 would be a small living area with some beds, storage attached and all the necessaries. These would contain new NPCS as well. Most NPCS do not serve a purpose, though there are a couple which have special perks that only are found here and not the Dungeon Hub.\n\nFirst one is a new magic NPC which will disenchant Ultimate Enchants, you get nothing back, but the slot for a Ultimate is back on, this NPC is found in the library room.\n\nThe second NPC is found in the first room, also known as the planning room. He will sell hints for certain rooms in the dungeon time to time, telling you where secrets may be lying to help out certain players. He has a small cooldown between hints of a day or two.\n\nThe third NPC is found in the loot storage, he doesn't serve much of a purpose other than a bazaar/auction/trading area for essence. Idea provided by: @70Ox\n\nThose are all the main NPCS, but some other NPCS will exist, they don't give secret locations or anything to buy, but they may tell you some tips and useful dialogue.\n\nOne NPC is located in the living area.\nVoice Lines: (Note: These are not in order, they will be randomized each time)\n1. Years of dungeons have tought me to instead rushing headfirst, cautious approaches can lead to more success.\n2. I remember when I first blew up a crypt, that zombie- It still scares me to this day.\n3. Why did I take this job?\n4. I wish I was out exploring those catacombs.\n5. A dungeon a day keeps the /g kick command away!\n6. Don't waste your time too much here, go explore the depths of the catacombs!\n7. Over time you will become better in these catacombs, its learning from your mistakes to become better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Part 2 - Perks/Bonuses:\n\n\n\nOnto the most important part that any Skyblock player needs, PERKS. The perks in order as well as how many contributions are require plus a new special part, in order to get certain perks you need to contribute a certain amount of times minimum on a very certain possible contribution. For example you may need to instead of using the cheapest perks available, now you must contribute to contribution #4 2 times in order to get the highest tier of perk. Now onto the perks.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Perks:\n\n\n\nPerk #1 - Contributions required: 4 | Gain 5% off on all dungeon related NPCS except for Malik.\n\nPerk #2 - Contributions required: 8 | Gain 10% off on all dungeon related NPCS except for Malik.\n\nPerk #3 - Contributions required: 16 - Special Contributions Required: At least 4 times on Contribution #3 or above | Gain 15% off on all dungeon related NPCS as well as 7.5% off on Malik and all reforge anvils.\n\nPerk #4 - Contributions required: 28 - Special Contributions Required: At least 4 times on Contribution #4 Plus 8 #3 Contributions | Dungeon Chests are 10% cheaper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Part 3 - Contributions:\n\n\n\nFinally onto what you will need to contribute in order to get these perks and the city project done in the first place, now since perk #4 and #3 are exceedingly powerful now in order to to adapt we make the contributions themselves more expensive. Now onto the contributions.\n\nContribution #1 - Excavation and Terraforming:\nDescription: In order to create space for the new headquarters we must terraform and excavate the environment, this will fund the team with the resources needed to get this job done.\n\nResources needed:\n1. 2 Enchanted Iron\n2. 1 Enchanted Oak wood\n3. 1 Enchanted Gunpowder\n\n\nContribution #2 - Materials and Structure\nDescription: Construction of the main structure and its new rooms will require resources which will be funded via this.\n\nResources needed:\n1. 64 Enchanted Dark Oak\n2. 32 Enchanted Cobblestone\n3. 8 Enchanted Sand\n\n\nContribution #3 - Catacombs Magic:\nDescription: Experiment with the catacomb's special properties to allow for new processes and breakthroughs in Skyblock.\n\nResources needed:\n1. 1 Enchanted Blaze Rod\n2. 8 Enchanted Eyes of Ender\n3. 16 Enchanted Glowstone\n\n\n\nContribution #4 - Dungeon Expertise:\nDescription: In order to fund those who have expertise in the art of adventuring in the catacombs to help us build and establish this new headquarters we will need some resources which will be funded from this contribution.\n\nResources needed:\n1. 1 Scarf Studies\n2. 64 Enchanted Melons\n3. 2 Enchanted Cookies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: TDLR:\n\n\n\nno this doesnt exist read it yourself i already condensed it in a small package i cant make this any smaller\n\n\n\nThank you for reading this post. Please leave any ideas or balancing.\n\nUpdates:\n\nUpdate #1: added a new section and currently working on balancing.\n\nUpdate #2: added new NPC\n\nUpdate #3: adding new NPCS and Voice lines."

But, seeing as I have all but two of the cakes (weak flex), I need to choose what I want to have on display. That's why I think that we should be able to increase the furniture cap, and I think this would fit perfectly as a profile/account upgrade in the community center. Only the first couple tiers would be available for free (thereby reducing possible lag), but each would give 10-15 more slots, giving more than enough of a cap to fit all that stat-buffing cake goodness."

Well, look no further, as the Magic Eraser can instantly destroy (almost) every vanilla block on your private island. All blocks that are destroyed do not go into your inventory and are just removed from the game.\n\nNow, of course, an item with an ability like this would cause way too many bugs if not playtested, so it would need a lot more work than many other items. The crafting recipe would have to be slightly expensive in order to make this item more than just a slight diversion for early players. so maybe making the recipe require a stack of enchanted sponge surrounded by 8 magenta dyes would work. Any suggestions are welcome in the comments."

    "body": "Since the spider pet came out, I've switched to Tarantula minions, as the spider pet at level 100 gives a 30% speed increase to spider and tarantula minions.\n\nTo level up the pet, I started doing F6's with it, especially when killing golems (as an archer I farm the golems, which gives over 5k combat xp each).\n\nHowever, when clearing the dungeons, I've noticed something weird.\n\nWhenever I had the spider pet equipped while killing Lost Adventurers, Frozen Adventurers, Shadow Assassins and Angry Archeologists, they would suddenly get speed hacks.\n\nI'm not joking. It was equally confusing and frustrating. They literally start zooming around with like 1000 speed, and I had no idea why. They became practically impossible to hit without splash weapons, and as an archer... yeah.\n\nThen I realized this only happens after I have the spider equipped, and hitting the mini-boss once. If I switch back to my blue whale, skeleton, or even wither, it would go back to normal. No weird speed hacked mini-bosses.\n\nBut what exactly makes the spider pet give mini-bosses speed hacks?\n\nIronically, I think it's the legendary spider pet's second ability:\n\nWeb-Weaver - Upon hitting a monster it becomes slowed by 40%\nI know it doesn't make sense, but listen.\n\nThis \"speed hack\" bug only happens when using the spider pet.\nAll of the other pet perks don't affect mobs at all.\n\nIt's not a coincidence that this ability affects mob speed. If any of the abilities were bugged, this would be the one.\n\nI don't know, but maybe the developers forgot to code the perk to affect dungeon mini-bosses the same as every other mob? Maybe the way mini-bosses are coded are so inherently different that Web-Weaver has a completely opposite effect?\n\nTo conclude, I don't think I'm the first guy to discover this, or even make a discussion post about it. But this has just been very confusing to me, and is practically forcing me to do Rev IVs to lvl it up, which is expensive and more time consuming.\n\nThoughts?"

Know EVERY-SINGLE secret in EVERY-SINGLE room. Yes, this is required. Go put in the grind to memorize 100+ secrets and you will be greatly benefited. \n\nSecret Guide:\n\n\nSpoiler: Discord\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the Dungeon Secret Guide Discord Server!\n\n\nThis server helps people that play Hypixel Skyblock dungeons by supplying them with the guides they need. | 23,996 members\n\n\n\n\ndiscord.gg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Use your tnt. When you see a crypt, blow it up if you don't have 5 crypts blown up. So many teams don't blow up crypts resulting in them getting slowed down. (crypts give bonus score). \n\n3. Know the power level of each mob. To survive, you not only have to have good gear, but have to know that a group of skeleton masters must be taken away by range. \n\n4. Have a dedicated route for every single room. A good route will allow you to get all the secrets as fast as possible. For example, for a certain room my route is to blow up the super-boom wall, go down the water stream, hit the lever, get the chest behind the lever wall, aote up, get the bat, get the chest. \n\n5. Make mage use thunderstorm to kill bats. If you have killed every mob in that room and the mage's thunderstorm doesn't his a bat, it died to something else and you move on. \n\n6. Don't. Skip. Rooms. If you see water puzzle or trap room, don't skip it for someone else to do, do it yourself. Or at bare minimum, call for a teammate to teleport to you. \n\n7. Speed. Just getting faster will help you. This can be done by splashing rabbit, for the mage to use rogue sword, for berserk and archer in Shadow Assassin to teleport, to put sugar rush on your boots, etc. \n\n8. Use your abilities when necessary. Abilities can speed up your run by a lot, so don't hold onto them. If you see a good scenario to use your ability, use it. As an archer, I used to save my Explosive Shot for minibosses, but now I use it on large clumps of normal mobs as well."

    "body": "I was exploring the unloaded islands with some other people on a park server, and decided to try putting an ender eye in the dragon's den bc why not. Turns out they can be thrown! We tried to follow it and ended up finding this... strange cobble water thing. I found this after @Poseidon7007 spotted it looking for a stronghold, so it's not my discovery. I will do more research looking into if this appears at servers other than the park, if this is a glitch, and other such things at a later date if new info comes up.\n(Poseidon ended up not posting anything on the forums bc I'm making the post in case you're wondering)\nEDIT: Reached 10k blocks out in that direction, found nothing\nEDIT 2: Found it at a Hub lobby, this thing is real. I wonder what it is?\nUPDATE: As of Version 0.9.11, you cannot travel too far away from. This means you cannot land onto this spot anymore, however, if you go to a park lobby and travel towards the coords, you can still see it, meaning it hasn't been removed."

    "title": "2.5K SPECIAL! MAGMA BOSS UPDATE IDEA! (megathread) (45+ positive reactions)",
    "body": "I worked hard on this for around 10 hours, so please bump and if you like it maybe either like or creative?\n\nMagma boss:\nChanges:\n\nHealth buffed from 150k->15 mil\nThere are three stages\nDamage cap changed to 25k\nStage 1: The fight\n\nThe boss regenerates 10k health per second\nAnyone who dies respawns\nAttacks: Ground slam, Fireball, Summon help, Heat wave\nGround slam: The magma cube Jumps 50 blocks into the air, launching players up 20, then comes down creating a shockwave that goes 20 blocks out and deals 100-1000 true damage based on how close you were to the center. This attack has a 35% chance to be used every 20 seconds and is used when the boss gets to 10% health. It is immune to damage during this time.\nFireball: The boss shoots fireballs at the players that have the most health, each dealing 75 true damage. They have aiming 10, so they are almost impossible to avoid. The boss shoots 10 fireballs in rapid succession before the fight and has a 50% chance to do it again when it reaches 50% health.\nSummon help: The boss summons four groups of blazes at the corners of the arena. Each group has 12 blazes. Each blaze has 50k health and shoots 3 fireballs in rapid succession every 5 seconds, each dealing 200 damage. They aim at random players. Until all of the blazes die, the magma cube has 90% damage resistance. This always happens when the boss hits 30% health.\nHeat wave: Every second, the boss deals 2.5% of a player\u2019s health in true damage to every player.\nStage 2: The team\nWhile stage 1 is mostly about killing it, stage 2 is about teamwork and healing each other.\nParts: There are three parts of stage 2\n\nPart 1: The box. A note block version of \u201cThe box\u201d by Roddy Ricch is played as players are stuck in a 11x11x11 box made of bedrock, with a block of endstone in the middle. This block takes 30 minutes to break with a clean diamond pickaxe, but players can combine their efforts to break it. There is lava 75 blocks up that is falling down. When players break this super endstone block, there is a hole that they can go through, falling back into the arena. The lava does 500 true damage per second. The lava flows as though it is in the overworld. It is one block lower the farther towards the edge. This means that people with armor like mastiff should stand towards the edge so that other people can go in the hole first. This lava does 100 less true damage per second with lava talisman.\nPart 2: The choosing. The magma boss summons the blazes from before, except their fireballs have aiming 1, and there are 8 groups. After they are defeated, the boss says that the third part will be even harder than the last two. You have to choose whether to be a swordsman (berserker), bowman (archer), or medic (healer). Swordsmen can only use melee weapons, bowmen can only use bows, and medics can only heal people. Then, part 3 happens.\nPart 3: The reckoning. Stage 1 happens again, except the boss has 20 million health and +25% damage. This time, if you die, you get trapped in the nether prison, which requires completion of all dungeon puzzles to progress. If you fail one, you have to wait for someone else to die and complete the one you were on before you move on.\nStage 3: The reward\n\nUnlike most boss fights, you are not competing against other players, you are competing against your past performances. There is nether weight.\nSwordsman/Bowman rewards: 70-79% of highest damage: 10 weight. 80-89% of highest damage: 15 weight. 90-99% of highest damage: 20 weight. 100-120% of highest damage: 30 weight. 121%+ of highest damage: 50 weight. 1mil-2.99mil damage: 30 weight. 3mil+: 50 weight. 1st: 20 weight. (Note swordsman/bowman rankings separate)\nMedic: 70-79% of highest healing: 10 weight. 80-89% of highest healing: 15 weight. 90-99% of highest healing: 20 weight. 100-120% of highest healing: 30 weight. 121%+ of highest healing: 50 weight. 100k-299k healing: 30 weight. 300k+: 50 weight. 1st: 20 weight.\nThings you can get:\nEnchanted magma cream 2.5% chance (guaranteed) (8th)\nEmber frags: 10 weight each (guaranteed) (7th)\nEmber hat: 30 weight \u00bc chance (6th)\nEmber chest plate: 40 weight \u00bc chance (4th)\nEmber pants: 35 weight \u00bc chance (5th)\nEmber boots: 25 weight \u00bc chance (7th)\nMagma travel scroll: 45 weight 1/6 chance (3rd)\nEmber rod: 75 weight 1/10 chance (2nd)\nMagma cube pet: 100 weight 1/10 chance (75% epic 25% legendary) (1st)\nExample: you did 1,143,762 damage as a Bowman, which is 94.3 percent of your highest. That is 20+30 weight, so a total of 50. The highest thing you qualify for is the magma travel scroll, and then the chest plate, etc. You don\u2019t get the scroll, so you roll for the chest plate. You don\u2019t get that either, so you roll for the pants, and don\u2019t get them. Time for the helmet, which you also fail to get. The boots are the last thing the rng rolls for before it gives you frags. You get the boots, and there is still 25 left, so you get two ember fragments and two enchanted magma cream.\nBuffs:\n\nEmber armor: Hat 40 hp->60 hp 35 def->55 def 5 int->20 int.

Similar to profile boosting but wont get you banned and its actually fair.

Since i don't have the strong dragon helmet and use a tarantula helmet instead, the DAMAGE may be different. BTW my zombie knight armor is EPIC. Also, if you check my skylea, my Zombie knight armor all dropped from floor 6 and may be low in quality. Note that this is not in dungeons!\nStrong Dragon: Legendary\nZombie Knight: Epic OR Legendary\n\nScenario 1: No Reforge:\n\nStrong Dragon: 25 str per piece (100 total)\nZombie knight:\nHelmet: 23 str\nChestplate: 43 str\nLeggings: 33 str\nBoots: 18 str\nTotal: 117 str\n\nScenario 2: With reforge (Fierce):\n\nStrong dragon:\nStrength: (25+10) * 4 = 140\nCrit chance: 6 * 4 = 24\nCrit damage: 18 * 4 = 72\nTotal: 140 str, 24 cc, 72 cd.\n\nZombie knight:\nStrength: (23+8) + (43+8) + (33+8) + (18+8) = 149\nCrit chance: 5 * 4 = 20\nCrit damage: 14 * 4 = 56\nTotal: 149 str, 20 cc, 56 cd.\n\nScenario 3: EHP includes 100 HP at start, no growth or prot [formula: HP x (def/100 + 1)]:\nStrong Dragon: 2700\nZombie Knight: 694\n\nScenario 4: EHP includes 100 HP at start, with growth 5 and prot 5\nStrong Dragon: 4290\nZombie knight: 3016\n\n1: Zombie knight (17 more strength)\n2: Strong Dragon (9 less strength, but 4 more cc and 16 more cd)\n3: Strong Dragon (2006 more EHP)\n4: Strong Dragon (1274 more EHP)\nConclusion: Strong Dragon armor is better than my epic zombie knight set. (wins 3-1) Please excuse me since i did a LOT of math and now i just want to die.\n\nEdit: If my zombie knight set was legendary, it would beat strong armor in scenario #2, which would make it a tie."

In my peripheral vision, something caught my eye. Something red. Something that looked dangerous. I heard a heartbeat as I approached it. It got louder and louder as I creeped towards it. It was a door the color of blood. I opened it up... and started to scream.\n\nOne hour ago, I was in the mines with 4 of my friends, getting some coal for the barbeque we were going to have tonight. As I dug my pickaxe into the stone, the rock crumbled apart. Right in front of me was a small tunnel that led down to a musty cave. I unsheathed my sword and went down the steps. My friends followed behind me, looking around cautiously with every step. I sliced through cobwebs as I ventured further, trying to be brave. As I turned a corner, a giant door came into view. All 5 of us ran towards it. \u201cWhoa, that\u2019s creepy,\u201d I said. The others nodded in agreement. I knocked on the door once. A low rumbling sound came from the other side of the door, and it slowly opened. \u201cYou first,\u201d Henry, one of my friends said. I stepped into the dungeon, and everyone else came in after me. The sounds of footsteps echoed deeper within the Catacombs, making us all shiver. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Oliva whispered. \u201cThere is no chance we\u2019ll survive this.\u201d We all turned around to leave. Right as I got to the door, it slammed shut. We were locked in.\n\nI will be updating the story in Creative Corner, go check it out! https://hypixel.net/threads/story-the-catacombs-unfinished.3497186/"

And then I could hear skeleton bones getting hit, skeletor bonemerang and everything and then me dying. Then I was in panic and restarted by pc. After this happened to me 3 times, I decided to investigate but soon lost interest. Well, after 5 days, I found what what the cause turns out I just switched into another desktop. A desktop is like a another tab, but with your pc. So how this is useful for gamers without time is that they can have ALL the games they want on 1 desktop and switch to another desktop which has well, the stuff u won't get trouble in it to avoid sus from your STRICT parents who won't let you play games but lets you go in your room. Now I can freely switch to another desktop.\nI use THIS:\n\n\n\n\nso if you lay four fingers on the touchpad and swipe it at the same time (depends if u wanna go to desktop 1 from 2, u swipe to the right, and if u want to go from 2 to 3, u swipe left)and it should take you there.

If you haven't watched it I suggest you do. Search \"Modern Farming\" on youtube and it should be the one by Minikloon. If not you can watch it here:\n\n\nSpoiler: video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo save you a bit of time I'll explain the new items showed here:\n\nInfinDirt- Wand\nPlaces a dirt block (costs 2 coins per block) \nYou do not need dirt in inventory to use\n\nPrismapump\nPumps water poured next to it\nEssentially this just expands the water source all the way to the end of your farm. Great for sugar cane farms\n\nHoe of Great Tilling\nTills a 5x5 area of farmland at a time\nThis makes tilling land so much more of a breeze\n\nBasket of Seeds\nAllows you to store seeds in one place and then place rows of them\nReally good for planting loads of carrots/potatoes at once since it goes to end of the farmland\n\nWe can assume that these items will be purchasable from the new Farm merchant which could be very costly, but very much worth it at the end of the day. In other words, farming is getting the attention it deserves, and now it will hopefully encourage more players to farm (which will drop the prices of crops but new tools to harvest them faster may be implemented to help you make bank off crops regardless of bazaar/npc price)"

    "title": "[IDEA] Skyblock Community Representatives (CRs)",
    "body": "Hello players and staff,\n\nI have recently conceived of an idea that may help you (staff) roll out more relevant updates and may help limit or even eliminate backlash from the community. So the idea is as follows. Staff pick players from the community at random, obviously there should be a way to eligibility requirements (see ^) for selection. Applications may be done through a link found in Jerry or on the forums. The idea is as follows we divide the player base into different stages such as early game/ mid game and late game. This can be edited later but the basics are, average skill levels as follows:\nUn-represented (see *): Avg. Skill level 0-4\nEarly game: Avg. Skill level 5-14\nMid game: Avg. Skill level 15-24\nLate game: Avg. Skill level 25+\nNow 1 eligible person who may be a well respected for every 5000 people these categories should be selected randomly by a auto select/ raffle command. Then if there is an update the admins/ staff will contact these people who should be trusted with pre-update knowledge and they will be able to give feedback on how the community may react. I'm not saying that admins are out of touch but I find that people react differently when they are talking to admins then to each other. (I know that the /nick commands exists but to be frankly honest there aren't enough admins to circulate and find out the broad majority of opinion.) The CRs will also give feedback on what the community wants (eg. less dungeon floor updates, lower the price of items [idk]) There is also another option to add a different channel to submit the \"[IDEA]\" posts and with the additional manpower of the CRs and the staff (see `)they will be able to get through more suggestions and this will ease the pressure off admins and will allow them to moderate, review appeals, develop and release the glorious updates. The idea of having multiple people from different stages of the game will allow the CRs to represent their game level. For example a Late Game CR may approve of raising Bazaar requirement because it does not impact the Late Game players however a Early Game CR may have a serious problem with that idea. The CR should be in \"office\" for 1 month or so this will help give everyone time to have a turn and share their ideas as a CR. It should be stressed that this position should not be advertised, there shouldn't be a role or special recognition.\n\n^\nEligibility requirements may include\nAge: (eg. 15+)\nNot already have a role of responsibility (eg. Staff, Youtube Role, Special roles ([PIG+++] etc. or mojang representative), this is to not sway their opinion and keep the CRs non-bias.\nNo punishments should have been inflicted on the player previously\nTrustworthy enough to not leak information\n\n*\nThese players should not be represented because people can progress through this stage extremely quickly and this stage is very short. Likely the CR/s will likely progress beyond this stage during office\n`\nPlease note I have specified that the CRs and the staff as separate as that's what they are they are simply regular players with direct communication privileges.\n\n\nAfter Note:\nI realise that there are many flaws in this idea but I truly believe that if this is nurtured enough that this might become a thing.\nAfter- After Note:\nPlease dont hate, I don't want that in my inbox, but do give CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM"

    "title": "[Idea] The Ironman Exclusive Quest for the Potato Talisman! (+20 POS. REACTIONS)",
    "body": "The Potato Talisman was a limited edition common talisman brought forward upon us by the Blood God himself. The issue is that it is now impossible to acquire on an Ironman profile because the NPC for it is a remnant of the past, and you\u2019re barred off from the auction house and are unable to trade with other players...\n\nBut who cares? It\u2019s just another common talisman...\n\nI care, of course. Every talisman makes a difference on Ironman profiles, and even if you don\u2019t think that +4 strength matters all that much, then imagine the OCD being flicked on all at once when players see 59/60 talismans on their Ironman sky.shiiyu\n\nThus, a solution!\n\nA new NPC will appear in a small underground potato farm under the farm house in the hub, he will look quite similar to a certain Potato addict... If you click on him, he will speak the following:\n\n[Potato Overlord] I have been farming potatoes for <Insert time here> and have yet to see the light of day...\n\n[Potato Overlord] Heh? You wish to defeat me? You are not even close to being worthy of considering such a role, peasant! Begone!\n\nAnd then... that\u2019s it... why...?\n\nThat\u2019s because you\u2019re not on an Ironman profile, dummy. If you were to talk to him on an Ironman profile, however...\n\n[Potato Overlord] I have been farming potatoes for <Insert time here> and have yet to see the light of day...\n\n[Potato Overlord] Heh? You wish to defeat me, the Blood God of Potatoes?\n\n[Potato Overlord] Very well... I am much too powerful for your feeble, mortal minds to comprehend my strategies, but perhaps... a consolation prize for your efforts...\n\nNew Quest! Farm <Insert Number> Potatoes\n\nOnce you have done that...\n\nNew Quest! Report back to the Potato Overlord\n\nIf you talk to him once again, a new set of dialogue appears...\n\n[Potato Overlord] It seems to me that you have grown far too weak to continue any longer. You, a mere mortal, have exceeded my expectations... however.\n\n[Potato Overlord] Now... about that consolation prize...\n\nA screen will appear! In the middle, the fabled Potato Talisman! You happily claim it...\n\n[Potato Overlord] If you wish to defeat me... farm for another five hundred years!\n\nAnd the quest is now complete.\n\nPotential issues\n\nIf implemented correctly, this should not pose any issues. The quest is exclusive to Ironman profiles, who are unable to trade with other players or use the auction house. The economy of potato talismans should not crash as a result of this addition.\n\nIf they are implementing this, Hypixel must go to every effort to make sure no loopholes is birthed from this addition, much like the dupe glitch from the co-op and private bank account like a month ago. I do not want Potato Talismans to suddenly lose that characteristic that made them unique in the first place.\n\nam i worthy enough to tag the blood god himself\n\nList of Potential Loopholes\n\nIronman player drops the potato talisman, allowing other players to pick it up. Wipe this problem by making it literally impossible to throw it out of your inventory\n\nA person should NOT be able to claim the talisman on their main profile if they have completed the quest on their Ironman profile.\n\nMake sure that the player is unable to claim the talisman if their inventory is full. This should be easy to patch, since the game already has a system to detect of the player\u2019s inventory is full. If a players tries to do this, the Potato Overlord should say: You really believe you can outsmart me with such primitive tactics? I\u2019ve studied the craft, and I\u2019ll have you know that I\u2019m twenty steps ahead of you! You\u2019re playing checkers while I\u2019m farming potatoes!!"

I gave him 400k to go and buy one and then i hop off for like 10 min to go eat and I come back downstairs to hear my brother screaming that his account was stolen and that he lost everything. I told him to explain in detail what happened he had 50k and needed 10 more k to add on to my 400k to make 460k. So he decieded to get help from someone random guy(notsayingnamessoIdontgetbulliedinthread) and he was asked to do a Co-op with him so my bro accepted then he was sent a kick this member out thing even though he was just kicking himself out. I know he didnt use his brain and accepted thinking that this was a friend request not even reading what it was. And thats what happened Admins maybe you could help him get his account back?

Want a mage setup with Demonic and Bizarre? Go for it! Want a berserker setup with Shaded and Hurtful? Easy to do! This would make switching builds so much easier, as you wouldn't have to reforge all of your talismans every time you wanted to switch.\nNow, when you switched wardrobe slots, the reforge would be applied to all accessories in your inventory and accessory bag. If you had any new accessories than the last time you switched, it would cost a fee to switch but ONLY for that time, to prevent people reforging for free.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: GUI Concept Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is just the wardrobe, but on right click, allows you to customize accessory build.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the GUI that would let you select which rarity of accessory you wanted to reforge, and what reforge to apply to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the reforge screen that would appear when you are going to change the reforge of the rarity. I forgot coin cost, but there will be a fee for doing this. The anvil in the top-left allows you to add reforge stones to your accessories.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced reforging screen. Pretty self-explanatory.\n\n\n\nNow this idea probably requires balancing, but I feel like something like this would make switching builds much easier and less tedious.\nPlease reply with any feedback, and thanks for reading!"

You can see all their weapons, armor sets, and talismans.\n3. You can see peoples inventory, ender chest, potion bag, fishing bag, etc. This means you can see people's items in their inventory.\n4. You can see their catacomb levels, slayer levels, and boss collections. With this, you can roast people and bully them on their trash slayer levels.\n5. SkyCrypt leads to a bunch of sites such as auctions.craftlinks.xyz and Plancke.io.\n6. You can see when you claimed Potato Talisman and Crab Hat so you know if someone is og or not."

It gets really annoying when I have to go underneath my farm, add a block, then break the block above it just to have a 1x1 water source. I propose the block pusher. It is a piston that when you click on the block, depending on the direction you are facing, reletative to the block, it pushes the block that way by 1 block.\n\nSo, if i was standing on top of my farm, I could use the block pusher to push a dirt block down so I wouldn't have to place another dirt block under it and then break the one on top. \n\nPretty much a portable piston.\n\nIt might be kind of hard to code but I feel like a lot of people would like this to be implemented into the game. Maybe have it sold at the bit's shop or farm merchant."

    "body": "So after some thought, I have decided to make a thread about Cake Buying.\n\n\nSpoiler: When Should I Buy Cakes?\n\n\n\nSo the general consensus is that Cakes will continue to go down until maybe 1-2 weeks after today, and I usually would agree. However, not today.\nI analyzed sharp 7 during the Darker Ah event, and these were my thoughts.\nSharp 7 Books\nDay 1 : 25m\nDay 2 : 12m\nDay 3 : 16m\nDay 4 : 18m\nDay 5 : I think it was like 18.5m?\nKeep in mind most books followed this pattern, but I only recorded sharp.\nTLDR : Stuffy says to buy your books now.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: If I want a full collection, how should I buy it?\n\n\n\nThere are two ways to get these.\n1. Go to the ah.\n2. Go out asking in the hubs.\nAS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED, I DONT BELIEVE #2 WILL WORK THAT WELL, BUT PEOPLE IS SB CONTINUE TO AMAZE ME WITH THEIR AMAZING FINANCIAL DECISIONS, SO DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK\nI will now focus on point #1.\nSo you want to use BIN. When I checked earlier today, there was a lot of volatility. This means that there was a lot of people selling for way cheaper than they should have. I do not know if the market has smoothened out by now.\nIf you just want the cakes, just buy the lowest BIN for each.\nIf you are willing to wait and potentially save maybe 1m? on the total set, here is what you do.\n1. Copy the phrase \"Century\"\n2. Go to lowest price.\n3. MEMORIZE the layout of the first row of the first page.\n4. Continuously switch between page 1 and 2.\n5. If the first row changes, then check the first row and see if you want to buy anything. If you buy anything, you will get kicked out of ah menu, so go back and type in the word century and keep going.\n6. Go back to step 3.\n\n\nHope this was helpful : )"

    "title": "How to calculate minion money making in a day.",
    "body": "We can find this out by dividing how many seconds there are in a day, by how fast the minion works, as an example, a tier 11-enchanted-lava snow minion works 5.2 seconds for 4 snowballs. So 86400 (how many seconds in a day) divided by 5.2 (minion speed) would work 16615 times in a day. We can then find out how much it really makes in a day with the next-next equation; if your minion made x4 things each time, it would make (find out via equation above)x(how many things your minion produces per interval)\nin case of a snow minion, it would make 16615x4 snowballs a day, or 66460 snowballs.\nSo this equation we will find out how much money it makes. So all you have to do is multiply how much 1 thing, (i.e snowballs) would make in 24 hours, i.e snow (again)\nso (how many of such thing your minion produces a day)66460x0.1(how much it costs) equating to 6646. Meaning a snow minion selling snowballs would make 6646 in a day. If prices for the compacted version of your item (snow is more yes). You would do the equations above and then; (single items produced by snow minion daily)\n16615x9.1 (how much snow blocks sell on bazaar) the answer would equal\n151916. Meaning a snow minion makes a crap ton of money. If you want to find out price for enchanted, just divide how many things it takes to make enchanted via minion (a lot have 160) divided by how many things your minion makes a day. Example; 16615/160 which will equal 103. Then you do common sense math (enchanted block)x(price of it) which for the example equals 103x600=61800. Meaning that out of all these methods (for snow minions at least) compacted snow minion is the best.\n\nTL;DR do math AND compacted is best for snow minion"

    "title": "The Issue with City Projects (High Effort)",
    "body": "So City Projects were pretty scuffed the first time around. But everything was fixed with the second set right? Well partially...\n\nWhile the second set of City Projects has been progressing significantly faster than the first, there is a new issue with the contributions. The much higher contribution requirements worked exceptionally well for about the first week, with both projects receiving approximately 40,000 daily contributions. People were donating 3 or even 4 times a day to get these new perks, especially the Maddox discount. But while this worked for the smaller Farmer House project, an issue arose with the Bartender project. Everyone who was donating for the Maddox Discount REACHED their requirements. And just like that, contributions have slowed to a halt. The project is receiving around 15,000 daily contributions, or even less. The main driving force of the previous contributors have stopped donating, and the project will take another whole week to finish at this rate.\n\nSo now that we know the issue, what's the solution? While staff could set separate donation requirements for the discounts and perks for each City Project based on projected active donators. this strategy would require a lot of effort to maintain, and could be inaccurate. Instead, I believe staff should set these contribution requirements as PERCENTAGES of the total contributions. For example, the 4th perk on the Bartender's Brewery required 24 individual donations, and the total project requires 650,000 donations. This was a little too small in my opinion, as it only costs about 100,000 coins a day to contribute all 4 times, and donations stopped rolling in consistently around 85% completion (550,000/650,000 total). With the new system admins would look at the number of active contributors for each project, and set a requirement say to be within the top 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20% of contributors. Now instead of everyone stopping at 85% completion, players would be forced to compete all the way until the end of the project. Overall this would upset some people, as it would undoubtedly make the 4th perk harder to obtain, but I believe this competition would make City Projects more engaging, raise general community interest, and keep those contributions flowing in!\n\nTLDR: City projects stopping because contribution goals are reached. By changing to a percentage based system, players will donate for the entirety of the project, making the projects quicker, and raising community interest."

    "body": "Renovations\u200b\nOnce a community project is complete, once in a while, it needs to have renovations. As of right now, the community projects are unfair for new players - if you miss out on this opportunity, it's 10% slayer cost reduction, which adds up overtime. And once you miss it, you're never going to be able to get it back. I propose renovations every 2-3 months. I can imagine the build team making the place about to be renovated look cracked and rusty. These will add new features, and enable new players to gain the same perks. When the building is fully completed, then all previous perks will be removed (for that building) and will be replaced with the new perks. For instance:\n\nThe Blacksmith Workplace is getting rusty. Help renovate it to gain access to special perks!\n4 --> Access the shop 1 day earlier.\n8 --> Access the shop 2 days earlier.\n16 --> Shop items are 5% cheaper.\n24 --> Reforging is 5% cheaper (including the cost to apply reforge stones)\n\nNew Shop Items:\n- Bloodlust I (named after the UHC sword, also works the same way as expertise and compact): Gain 1 strength for 5 seconds after any enemy kill. Also gain 1% more combat xp. 50 kills to level up! - 4000 bits\n- Bunny's Legs: Grants 50 attack speed and 5 ferocity on legendary weapons, provides swift reforge, requires mining 10 to use, only appears in shop after killing 250 bunnies, costs 100,000 coins to apply - 250,000 coins.\nBunny legs are rare, since bunnies are extremely hard to catch. I wonder who caught it.\n- Tiger Claws: Grants 50 strength, 5 crit chance, 20 ferocity on legendary weapons (I'm too lazy to do the rest and tell me if this needs balancing), provides clawed reforge, requires mining 25 to use, costs 1,000,000 to apply - 2,500,000 coins.\nIt is said that tigers had one of the strongest claws. But how did this end up here?\n- Reforge talisman: obtained after reforging 100 different items, reforging is 1% cheaper (uncommon) - 250,000 coins\n- Reforge ring: obtained after reforging 250 different items, reforging is 2% cheaper (rare) - 500,000 coins and Reforge talisman\n- Reforge artifact: obtained after reforging 500 different items, reforging is 3% cheaper (epic) - 1,000,000 coins and Reforge ring\nAll items reforged prior to this count.\n\nThis could go on for the slayer community project, and perhaps give a new type of slayer or a tier 5 spider. And perhaps for the farm one, adding more stuff to farming collections.\n\nI feel like renovations will make it easier for admins to pump out small content updates, which favors old players, and help new players gain access to the perks which they are missing out on (just imagine if you missed out on the 10% slayer cost reduction permanently, wouldn't that suck?).\n\nAlso, I propose two more components to each building, but keep the 24 hour cooldown. This makes it so that instead of having to contribute for 6 days, you only have to contribute for 4. Neat!\n\nFeel free to tell me any suggestions!\n\nTL;DR: Basically renovations add new features and give new perks but take away the old ones."

It costs a lot to actually have good stuff to do it\n3. Everybody does it thus zealots are harder to get\n\nNow let's talk about the reasons\n1. We all know that once you reach 420 zealots your chance of getting one goes up by 10% that's not big buff I once spent 2-3 hours getting to 1123 and finally got one\n\n2. The new meta with grinding efficiently is having an fscythe with full set of wise dragon armor wise armor is going for 2mil rn and an fscythe is going for 7mil add those up and that equals 9mil you can be spending that 9 mil on dungeons gear\nSo you have to spend about 9mil to make zealot grinding effective\n\n3. This one ties into #2 and that's everybody does zealot grinding most the people that grind zealots use the setup I said earlier so if you dont have that setup you're going to have a bad time\nThe advantage of having the setup I said is its ranged so you dont actually have to go up to the zealot\n\nThanks for reading also inb4 just mad cause bad"

These are simply concepts for the items and bosses.\n\nThe custom textures are from the Resource Pack FurfSky+ or Skyblock Dream.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Feedback\n\n\n\nStronger bosses - The T5 bosses, as listed in the post, are far too weak. In-game they would likely need to be stronger.\nWeapons too strong - The axe can do ridiculous damage and the bow is just a Runaan's bow with twice the damage. They are Op\n100% drops - This would make the bosses op for money making. Perhaps make them drop less of the item, or make the boss cost more to fight\nNew drops are too rare - 1/10000 is a bit excessive, perhaps lower it to 1/5000."

  {
    "title": "My thoughts on the farming update leaks!",
    "body": "So recently, Minikloon posted some stuff on his twitter. He deleted it, but you can see both leaks in this video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, the main problem about this update is the increase to the farming cap. This is seen in the first leak, and it seems that the top 5% of people who collect the most of a specific item get a increase to there farming level. From the picture, it seems that the new cap will be around 55. At the current exp table, it seems this would be a minimum of 20,000,000 more to get to farming 55, if we are guessing that it will be the same exp per level to get from 49 to 50 (which probaly won't be true, since it increases every level so far). So, this is going to be bad. This is a lot of exp, and even if you have enough exp, it probaly won't be easy to get a chance at unlocking these levels.\nThe next problem is the farming sweats. There are a lot of people who have farming 50, and these players will have a HUGE advantage in this event. This will make getting the new tickets to buy the items that are added to the farm merchant locked behind either having farming 50 or the ability to play for 5 days and 4 hours straight without sleeping and stopping. As a person with a busy schedule, this means that it is almost impossible for me to ever get these special items, since I can only play for around 2/3 hours a day. This is horrible, since the only way to get these farming levels is to grind for the whole event.\nThe next problem is in the second tweet, where he says, and I quote \"Earn tickets from participating in Jacob's contests. Spend them on better hoes and make farms in one nanosecond\" There are two things about this tweet I need to talk about.\nThe first is that these items will cost Jacob's tickets, which can only be gotten in the collection event. That means this situation is basically the rich get richer. If you win one of these events, you can get better at the event. This makes it harder for new players that join after the first few of these events, since they won't have easy access to these helpful items. I really hope that these Jacob's tickets are sold at the bazaar, since that would help new players be able to do better in these events.\nThe next thing is that you can build farms in a nanosecond. The only way I can see this possible is a almost ctrl c ctrl v type of item, which is horrible. This would make the builder wand completely useless, and makes people who build farms for a living have no purpose. This would help making farms better, but I feel that they could have done this better. Maybe they could have added something that placed water faster, or made something that would help the builder wand with farms (like making them possible to place crops).\n\nIn total, I think that they need to do quite a few things before this update is released."

Items like the personal compactor were added for the players that dont wanna pay money for fast craft.\n\ntake this with a grain of salt idc but i think a collection update would be cool"

There are loads of parties.\nLevels 5-10 have F2, F3, maybe F4. There are again, plenty of parties.\nLevels 10-14 have F4, and fail at F5 and F6. Plenty of parties for this.\n\nBut, I'm Catacombs XVII (17) and I want to do F6 for the EXP and money. The thing is, despite my almost 27 skill avg, 300k slayer exp, and over 200mil networth (sky.lea.moe/stats/Cybermarb/coconut) and the fact that I can, with a good party, beat F6 - all parties are either bunches of level 13-14 players trying to get someone to carry them, level 18-23 people doing pretty well, or 23+ tryhards destroying Sadan.\n\nSo - how am I supposed to do Dungeons?

It will also balance out the inflation of the economy by introducing something interesting.\n\nOne of the negatives is that the price cap is set to frags price of bazaar, so if superior frags are 250k/frag, and chestplates cost 80 frags, the price cap would be set to 20,000,000 for a chestplate. This effectively would make fragments much more viable, but able to be afforded by people who had low prices, instead of actually having to bid on random things, like chestplates, but now they dont have to compete during this.\n\nIf you support my idea, go ahead give it a yes in the poll, but if not, give it a no.\n\nThe dragon container allows players to sell dragon items to the Dragon Auction. This allows players to convert 10 frags to 1 enchanted gold ingot. If not enough players give 10 frags to the Dragon Auction, it will only have the Dragon Container instead."

    "title": "Just a list of Skyblock Item ideas.",
    "body": "I wanted to have a list of ideas, it'd be really nice if they were added, but I also want to know what the community says about them.\nAlso, items that I made posts about were tweaked, to be less OP.\n\n1. Metronome\nWell, you might have seen my earlier post about the Metronome, you'd know what I'm talking about. Have you ever just wanted more Pokemon references? Or maybe you want that sweet, sweet Molten wave, but just don't have 100mil in the bank. Or perhaps you just like to gamble. Whatever the case, this may be the item for you (if you have a surprising amount of luck).\n\nThe Metronome is an item that, when used, uses a random skill for the cost of 50 mana, that's fine and dandy, until we get to the real meat. Not only can you casts randomized spells, but the metronome can also be deadly, along with spells, the spells can backfire and deal a random% of your max HP, the spells have a 10% chance of backfire, but that still means you should be careful. And, if you're anything like my older brother, stay away from this item. (My older brother is so unlucky, that others around him just get luckier)\n\n\nSpoiler: Crafting Recipe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Sacrificial Dagger\nThe Sacrificial Dagger is an item that I wrote about, but I renamed it and balanced it up. Have you ever just played Persona 3 and wanted to summon your own persona? Well, sucks it's not a gun, it's a dagger. Only true gamers would get that reference. Maybe you want to do self harm because you didn't get the reference. Or perhaps you just need a way to be a tank, but also be useful. Here's an item you should be interested in!\n\nThe Sacrificial Dagger is a dungeon weapon that has +100 dmg and +90 Str, however, the ability is what you want, for a mere 35% of your max HP + a Healing drought (Cannot heal) for 10 seconds and a 15 second cooldown, you can deal massive amounts of damage to every monster within 10 blocks (10 meters), of course the damage scales with your HP, 10 times, to be exact. So while mages deal like 10k damage with this, seasoned tanks'll dish out way more than 500k, outdamage those mages.\n\n3. Condensed Joy\nCondensed Joy is a Reforge stone that, when applied to armor, gives the \"Jolly\" prefix, +10 speed, +35 HP, and 1% more Gifts During Gift Attack. You can get it by, you guessed it, opening gifts. There's really nothing more to say about this item.\n\n4. Werewolf Talisman/Ring/Artifact\nHey, hey, hey! I bet you like Ferocity with Werewolf armor! But what if you want MORE Ferocity, this is the item for you! The Werewolf Talisman/Ring/Artifact gives +2/+4/+8 Ferocity with the rarities Uncommon/Rare/Epic. Although, quite expensive, that's normally how Skyblock works.\n\n\nSpoiler: Crafting Recipes\n\n\n\nPS, All the \"leather\" is Werewolf skin, I don't have a texture for it yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Jerry Blaster\nIf you've ever played Gungeon, you'll likely know what this does. Have you ever just wanted to destroy Minibosses and regular Bosses, but you don't want to harm their underlings.. for whatever reason. Or maybe you just want to kill a boss on your own. Or perhaps you like meme items. Whatever the case, this Jerry Item will sure put a Jerry on your Jerry! Jerry.\n\nThe Jerry Blaster is a dungeon item that shoots Jerrys at enemies, dealing 1 damage at the cost of 1 HP. Y'see, the Jerry Blaster has a not-so-secret ability that is displayed on the item's lore, It can deal ridiculous damage to Bosses and Minibosses, though it may not be of use to people about floor 2, that's why damage scales depending on the floor dealing 10k more damage than before. It also requires Catacombs 10.\n\nPlease reply any changes I should make, so these items aren't ridiculously OP or UP."

    "body": "As we're waiting for the next floors to come out, I've decided to make some ideas for the upcoming floor 9 boss, storm. I chose storm due to him having the most clear theme yet can be made into many things. Hope you enjoy!\n\n\nSpoiler: The wall of text\n\n\n\nActually, reading would be boring and won't show the ideas as clearly. Why not some actual gameplay?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: FIGHT BREAKDOWN\n\n\n\nThis fight features storm, the elementalist, with 4 unique phases, each with different abilities!\nThe fight takes place in a large arena, surrounded by mountains and covered with clouds. It is outdoor to let storm use his weather powers to its best!\nI recommend watching the video before reading these!\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 1 - The Disciples\n\n\n\nStorm greets you, then summons 5 disciples to fight you.\nEach disciple has 10mil HP has has 3 different abilties:\n- Teleport around the arena\n- Summon a streak of lightning which moves forward\n- Summon 2 streaks of lightning which moves diagonally.\nWhile you can easily heal against this, getting hit multiple times in a row can be fatal especially if healer is not in reach. The lightning streaks move in a straight line and can be avoided to minimize taking damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2 - The Storm\n\n\n\nStorms now fights you himself. A mechanic is introduced: From now on, getting hit by any attacks will prevent any forms of healing except for Wish for 15 seconds. Players should avoid getting hit at all costs!\nStorm himself has 200mil HP and phase ends when he has 100mil HP. This phase features 4 abilities and a summon:\n- Teleport randomly around the arena, indicated by line of particles. Players near him or his destination will take damage.\n- Fires 5 evenly spread energy bolt forward.\n- Rapidly fires a somewhat inaccurate barrage of energy bolts\n- Creates waves of white energy which slowly homings into players.\n- Summons Lightning Elementals which can jump around and deal damage when landing. They only have 500k HP and should easily be taken care of.\nStarting from this phase, things start becoming different. Attacks will not hurt as much but will slowly wear down players until they die, preventing recovery if they are not careful.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 3 - The Seasons\n\n\n\nStorm fully recovers hp and shift into the next phase. This phase ends when he reaches 20mil HP.\nHe now introduces another restriction on the players: When using a movement abilty such as aote or grappling hook, all your movement abilties will be disabled for the next 5 seconds. Players have to be very careful about their positioning to minimize damage taken.\nHe transform into a seasonal elemental who cycle through seasons of the year and uses many abilities based on the season he is in. The cycle are in this order with these abilties:\nSpring Downpour:\n- Fires a constant stream of water.\n- Summons many water geysers which constantly deals damage after a delay.\n- Summons a large storm cloud which rains down mine orbs. Mines doesn't explode instantly so players can detonate them and run away safely\nSummer Heatwave:\n- Fires a spread of flame.\n- Create heat clouds which slowly chases player and constantly deal damage.\n- Summons a firestorm cloud, raining fireballs which creates massive explosions.\nAutumn Windcurrent:\n- Fires a gust shot which pushes players back\n- Creates a line of autumn wind which moves forward, then dashes to the end of the line, slashing anyone in the way. This is repeated several times.\n- Creates a tornado which slowly draws in players, dealing fatal damage to anyone in it and randomly firing leaf projectiles outwards.\nWinter Hailfall:\n- Lobs a large snowball which creates a lingering field of ice, slowing players.\n- Fires a large ice bolt which splits into many smaller ones as it travels.\n- Summons a blizzard which makes giant hail cubes fall down on players for a duration.\nThe attacks in this phase can be used in tandem and can be challenging for many. The movement restriction also makes it much harder to run away from attacks and makes using items like AOTE much more strategic. But this isn't the end yet.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 4 - The Tempest\n\n\n\nStorm once again fully heals. He commends you on making this far, but this will be the end for you!\nHe is now surrounded by \"Cloud Shield\", rendering most attacks on his useless while it is active. Tempest Clouds also starts spawning throughout the arena, zapping the ground at a nearby player's location after a delay.\nThis phase features 5 more different attacks which can demolish players not paying attention:\n- Transforms into a ball of dark cloud, dashing around players leaving Remnants which explodes when players are nearby, dealing massive damage.\n- Call several pairs of Tempest Wolves which charges towards player very quickly.\n- Summons Tempest Shadow which chases players and perform a swipe attack when a player is nearby.\n- Creates a shockwave followed by 8 waves of energy.\nOccassionally he will fire a beam at one of the clouds, attempting to supercharge it. After 6 seconds, the cloud becomes black cloud which can strike repeatedly, leaving a static field which damages players walking through it.\nAny attacks on the cloud that is currently being charged will make the cloud burst and send the charge right back at storm, exposing him to all attacks for a while! Players must be very quick to response to it or the phase can last for an extended amount of time.\nNow, defeat storm!\n\nThanks for reading and hope you enjoyed!"

    "body": "Hello everyone!\nThis is my first effort post so please mind the errors.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Introduction\n\n\n\nSo here is the idea. Currently dungeons and the end are the only places that provide significant minibosses that actually put up a fight, (the ender dragon and the golem just get pummeled too so that hardly counts) I am suggesting a new island dedicated to combat. This island would also help find content for those who hate doing this with other people as each boss is fought solo. Now this might sound just like dungeons but here is the thing, it is similar to the ender dragon and dungeons combined. Read on to find out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: The Island Layout\n\n\n\nThe island would look like a giant sandwich (just warning you this aspect of the island will need significant improvements as I am extremely bad at coming up with designs). Each layer of the island would require a different combat level and gets harder as you go. Each layer would have a different biome with different mobs on it.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: \u201cThe Enderman\u2019s Lair\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: The mobs\n\n\n\nEach biome would have different mobs as stated before. The first biome would be for people with combat 5 and higher. It contains enderman with 1500 health. Each time you kill an enderman it has a 1 percent chance of dropping a piece of the ender king.\n\n\nSpoiler: The Ender King\n\n\n\nYou would need to obtain all 4 pieces of the ender king to summon him. The pieces would be as follows: The Ender Crown, The Robe of Strength, The Robe of Wisdom, The Robe of Steel, The Robe of Nutrition, The Leggings of Height (help I\u2019m not creative, I can\u2019t come up with something for his pants), and The Boots of Speed. Each Robe will give the boss a different ability. The boss has 50k health and deals 1000 damage per hit (is affected by defense) When the boss reaches 50 percent health, the nearest 15 enderman agro on you.\n\n\nSpoiler: The Robes/The Boss Fight\n\n\n\nThe Robe of Strength: Every time his health lowers by \u00bc he will do a charge attack dealing 50 percent of your health, normal damage buffed by 50 percent. The Robe of Wisdom: Sword is replaced by a staff, melee damage nerfed by 50 percent, When attacking, the boss shoots fireballs at you dealing 10 percent more than normal melee damage. Every time this boss\u2019s health drops by \u00bc he summons lightning, dealing \u00bc of your health but disabling defense for 10 seconds. When he reaches 50 percent health he summons clones who look exactly like him (taken from Livid) But each clone only deals 30 percent normal damage. The Robe of Steel: This boss is based off of the protector dragon, except it will not be so underwhelming, each hit you deal to this boss deals 5 percent of that hit back to you, Every time his health drops by \u00bc he takes 25 percent less damage. The last and final boss The Robe of Nutrition has 300 percent health and pretty much just that.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: The Loot Tables\n\n\n\nEach boss drops 3-16 enchanted eyes of ender\nEach boss has a 10 percent chance to drop an orb of its kind (more on that later)\nEach boss has a 1 percent chance to drop an aspect of the end\nEach boss has a 0.001 percent chance to drop an ender slayer 7 book\n\n\nSpoiler: Orbs\n\n\n\nEach orb can be applied to the Raider\u2019s Axe. The Strength Orb: Adds 30 strength and 30 damage, The Wisdom Orb: Gives +200 intelligence and adds the ability to teleport 4 blocks on right click, The Lead Orb: Gives 75 defense, and finally, The Healthy Orb: This orb gives 200 health. Each orb can be added in a normal anvil for 0 xp. Once all of the Orbs have been applied the axe becomes the Marauder\u2019s axe, which adds 50 crit damage and 50 crit chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is still a work in progress suggestions and constructive criticism is encouraged, the next level will be similar to gym battles in Pok\u00e9mon."

    "title": "Suggestion: Minion Wardrobe",
    "body": "I have an idea that will allow players to easily optimize their minions to their current situation with nearly zero hassle. Allowing players to use different minion setups for different situations with ease.\n\nBasically, you will have a minion wardrobe menu in your nether star (or some item) that has four options, choose minion setup, create minion setup, delete minion setup, and minion bag. By clicking create minion setup, the game will remember the positions and minion upgrades of all the minions on your island and will save that data. You will name the setup and from that point on you can access that setup from the choose minion setup section of the menu. Using the same name as another saved minion setup will overwrite that setup.\n\nNow let's say you decide to navigate to choose minion setup and select a different minion setup (or the default un-deletable no minions active setup). First, all your active minions and the minion upgrades your minions were holding will go into your minion bag. Minion storages will not be collected, they will simply become inactive, but will reactivate if a minion is placed next to them. All the items in your minions will be collected and put into your minion materials bag, the player will never be able to interact with this bag. Then, items will be taken out of your minion bag to create the newly selected minion setup. If possible, materials from your minion materials bag will be deposited into minions of that corresponding type continuously until your minions materials bag is empty. For example, if you have 64 stacks of enchanted redstone blocks in your minions materials bag and you place a redstone minion, that minion will be instantaneously filled with enchanted redstone blocks until your minions materials bag is empty. Minions that are full will never be filled up by this bag though, even if they have automated shipping.\n\nIf you don't have the materials in your minion bag to make the new minion setup or if the positions of your minions in the new minion setup are obstructed then you will default to the no minions active setup and get an error message. The tier of your minions will not be accounted for when deciding whether or not you have adequate materials in your minion bag, simply the highest tier minions available will be used. When you switch minion setups every minion on your island will instantly break all the blocks they can reach and interact with (without getting the materials) in order to make room for the new minion setup.\n\nThe player can always take items out of and put items in their minion bag at will, and the minion bag will ideally have enough space so that space will never be a problem. If your minion bag is full when you change minion setups the items will be put into your storage bag until room is made in your minion bag. The way the player interacts with delete minion setup is pretty self explanatory so I won't explain it."

    "body": "With the addition of ferocity, the tiger pet was changed from a Level 100 legendary having 20% to strike twice (20% more damage on average) to 100 ferocity. Assuming you have 0 other ferocity bonuses, this literally DOUBLES your damage. If you have 100 ferocity without the pet, it gives 50% more damage. If you have 200 without the pet, it gives 33% more damage. This is much more powerful than the old ability. Only with 400 ferocity without the pet will it give 20% more damage.\n\nAfaik, it is hard to increase ferocity to 100 without this pet, so it should give more than 50% extra damage. From the description on the patch notes, it seems like this extra damage is multiplicative with bonuses like attack speed, strength, and crit damage.\n\nAm I missing something, or has no big youtuber exposed this and blew up the price yet?"

But at that time I don't know it's fully maxed and he declined the trade, so i'm guessing that he wants my armor. So I did offer him my armor, but I have experienced an scam before so I don't know will he scam me (Because it is in an backpack, it could be anything) so I asked him kindly to take the armor out of the backpack. He shows me a maxed recombulated Shadow assassin sets to me and he's gone.\n\nI was shocked at that time, I lose an opportunity to be good at dungeon because I don't trust someone from the way he act."

    "title": "How To Start Skyblock As A Beginner!",
    "body": "This is how you start skyblock as a beginner! The 1st step is to do /hub and then go slightly to the right and up and start farming some wheat. Sell that wheat to get a rookie hoe at the farm merchant (to the right of spawn, don't go too far), and keep farming wheat until you are farming 7. This should take about 8 minutes if you are doing it right. Next, craft 5 hay bales to craft the farming tailsman with 4 seeds and 5 hay bales.\n\n\nSpoiler: Recipe\n\n\n\nhttps://hypixel-skyblock.fandom.com/wiki/Farming_Talisman (scroll down for recipe\n\n\n\nSell all the leftover wheat and seeds, and buy a pickaxe at the mining merchant (go to the left of spawn, not to far though, and go up until you see a miner on your right side). You want to buy a promising pickaxe, and then go to the coal mine! Mine the coal as it gives more mining exp. After you get mining 1, go to the gold mine portal and mine coal (just mine there, there's more coal and space) until you are mining 7. Sell all of the cobble coal iron and gold (if u mined other things). \n\nNow, you should buy a jungle axe at the auction house (it's the biggest building close to spawn). It should cost about 1k-20k because some people like to bully new players. OR you can buy a promising axe at the lumber merchant (go through the bazaar and keep walking forward.) now start mining trees till you are foraging 7. \n\nNow you unlocked the bazaar, you should focus on combat! Go to the weaponsmith and buy an undead sword. Now you have to unlock the deep caverns, a spooky place if you don't know how to block hit without armor. The deep caverns portal is located in the gold mine. Go to the spawn of the gold mine and just keep running forward.\n\nNow you have unlocked the deep caverns. You should try to find the lapis quarry and not use the glitch because you might lose the coins or get warned or banned. But if you want to use the glitch, check out this video (even though i don't recommend doing it):\n\n\nSpoiler: Glitch Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnow start selling lapis armor pieces until you get enough money to buy ender armor! also get combat 14.\nwelp thats the end of my somewhat effort post\n\nTL;DR: get farming, foraging and mining 7, grind lapis pieces"

Watchdog has been banning people for clicking constantly without moving, So players that have been placing weights on their mouses or keyboards etc, have been getting banned cause hypixel out of the blue changed their rule on this.

At the beginning of May I had a break from Skyblock and in June I went on a 3-month vacation and when I came back he didn't play there anymore (he ended the relationship with me recently), so I got all the minions that he took with him when he left our island, and also the chests for them (there were two that I am applying for - snow minion t11 with xx-large storage, of course I ask for the rest too) there were 12 of them, each minion had a chest.

I wil try make good post instead of bad post. I made idea ****post and good ****post. I am going to make PRO post from now on to become PRO. This was an effort post leave a like pls.\nView attachment 2089917\nHere are the posts i made hope u like \n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: idea\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: The Dark Depths\n\n\n\nU thought this was gonna be good. Sike\n\n\nSpoiler: Actually click this :)\n\n\n\nThis is an idea I have had for quite a while now and pertains to a new farming/foraging island. The areas of combat, mining, and fishing have pretty much become oversaturated with ideas and I couldn't seem to find any reason of coming up with an idea for those. Instead I choose to take a look at foraging as not much has been done after the park update and minor changes to tools and such. This is a wip. I will add more info.\n\nThe Dark Depths (please reply with a better name this sounds ****) is a new foraging/farming island that is farther behind the park and is a bit farther away from every other island. This is going to be important to the lore later. In this, night vision is disabled and the island grows continuously darker as you go further into the forest. Here is a small map that I made to display my visions for this sort of island:\n\n\nSpoiler: Plans\n\n\n\nThese are kinda **** but I did them quite fast. Ill make these more detailed later\nView attachment 2087879\nThis is the overview of the island\nView attachment 2087882\n\n\nThe green part towards the center of the island is going to be a forest similar to the park with the game mechanics but is going to be much larger and dense. There will be a path going inside the forest all the way to the back that is surrounded by like 2 layers of unbreakable trees (to keep the effect) and will grow darker until you reach a cave in the mountain. This would be a quest spot to a new npc and lead to a sort of underground coliseum (similar to the thorn one but undergrounded and run down with vines everywhere. This in itself is going to be important for later but ill explain foraging and farming stuff first.\n\n\nSpoiler: Forest\n\n\n\nKeeping with the dark forest theme and whatnot the trees that can be broken will have a small chance to spawn a new set of mobs. These would give both foraging and combat xp and would be quite challenging. The trees themselves will be similar to the trees in the dark oak place of the part but much larger, taking several treecap hits to break just one tree. There would also be mushrooms everywhere for farming xp and some new stuff explained in the farming xp part. Not much will change in relation to treecutting other than the mobs:\n\n\nSpoiler: Forestry mobs\n\n\n\nThese mobs would spawn when cutting trees randomly. Not all would be hostile.\nEntrapped fairy\nFairy trapped deep in the core of the tree by dark magic hundreds of years ago\nWill give you some valuable loot in return such as 250k-1m coins and some essence.\n\nTrueborn Protector\nThis is basically an iron golem that spawns when breaking a tree.\nDoes a ton of damage (not going to say here for balancing's sake) and the only way to hurt it is to spawn undead woodsmen. This has a low chance of spawning.\n\nWoodsmen\nThese spawn a bit more often then trueborn protector's and when killed drop their souls. This is a piece of wood and can spawn undead Woodsmen to help you against the trueborn protectors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: The mines\n\n\n\nThe mines are an area at the very back of the dark forest. These are ancient and very dark. The first sign that you see as you approach the mines is a small 1 block crack in the wall. You walk through this in a small cramped room with an npc in one corner. Rocks and gravel adorn this room. The new npc is called Hercules. He says several voice lines:\n\n\nSpoiler: Voice lines\n\n\n\n[Hercules]: You have finally arrived humble adventurer\n[Hercules]: Leave now while you still can.\n[Hercules]: Tread deeper into these caves and see your worst nightmares\n\n\nAfter these lines a new menu opens. He sells several items such as an op sword and a new item knows as the miner's light. This gives some form of night vision and is the only way to see inside the deeper portions of the cave. As you travel deeper in the cave, several mobs spawn that you must fight. In the center of the mountain there is the thorn arena I spoke about earlier but is much darker and worn. When you step inside you speak to a new npc to begin the gladiator trials. I will write more about this in the spoiler.\n\n\nSpoiler: Gladiator trials\n\n\n\nThis is a new challenge. When you speak to the npc you are given the choice between the difficulty and the number of waves. This gives more coins based on how many enemies you have slain and there are also rare drops you can sell only to the new merchant. However, to receive these rewards, after the challenge, you must fight another player (like the coliseum) but with only iron armor and an iron sword. This can be done in 4s,2s, and solo with the difficulty scaling accordingly an the coins split.\n\n\nHere is a map for reference\n\n\nSpoiler: Image\n\n\n\nView attachment 2090184\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Good ****post\n\n\n\nDebunking the midas spoon. So people think that the Midas spoon is the best weapon and it so good for dungeons and omg so expensive. I will debunk this. This will require an in depth investigation in these spoons.\nFirst: How were these spoons made?\n\nThis spoon shoots gold every time u use ur mana and it is made of pure gold. This means that a lot of gold is coming from somewhere and we dont know where. So, the first suspect is an interdimensional portal that shoot out the gold. Now this is a stretch but we must look at it from all angles. So let us say that it is in fact a portal. Where is this gold coming from. It can be fit to assume that this gold is coming from a melted pool and it solidifies when passing through the portal. However, where is this pool of gold. Everyone is too broke to have a pool of gold. Now lets assume this gold comes from magical means and that this gold is infinite. Now this has a chance of happening. We know many people like dupecical and myntrix use glitches and dupes. What if those are just cover-ups for this pool and they have access to it? Now this would be bad as inflation would break economy if there is infinite pool of gold blocks. I am sure that dupecical and other people with access to this would be richer so lets assume this isnt true. If this is true wow ur broke to have infinite gold and not being able to afford a 1b midas.\n\nNow, let us assume that this gold is coming from the spoon. This means that the spoon is very concentrated gold and that it expands some of that gold and shoots it out. Sounds like something most of us know. This means that tiny fragments of gold are being lost. Therefore spoons actually have durability and one day when you shoot it you will find there is no spoon left. Now you have a stick. Whats a stick worth? I calculated it below\n\n\nSpoiler: Value of stick\n\n\n\nLets say you get a coin every time you get a girlfriend. Now lets say this stick is worth the same amount of coins as you got from all these girlfriends. Assuming the average iq of a skyblock forumer, the value of a stick is:\n0\n\n\nSpoiler: Was I not subtle enough?\n\n\n\nLet me say it again to u kids that didnt get it:\nView attachment 2090243\nthat is 0. Meaning 0 coins.\n\n\nGiven that this is the most probable outcome, let us assume it is true. So now in like 20 years your spoon aint gonna be worth ****. Sell it to some non before they see this. Idk about u but I rather kill things with a sword than a stick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Bad ****post\n\n\n\n\nView attachment 2089960"

Let's use the heavier, real life weights instead.\n\nHeavy collections:\nCobblestone = 2515 kg/m^3 (I'll stop saying m^3 after this is done, but this is necessary so no one gets confused.\nIce = 919 kg/m^3\nObsidian = 2600 kg/m^3\nIron (Block) = 7 873 kg/m^3\nGold (Block) = 42,549 kg/m^3\nIron (Ingot) = 874 kg\nGold (Ingot) = 4727 kg\nPorkchop = 272 kg (Animals are a special case - their drops absorb all of their weight) (Yes that's how it works in real life too)\nDiamond (Block) = 3 514 kg/m^3\nDiamond (Regular) = 390 kg\nAll types of wood = 800 kg/m^3\nCoal =25 kg\nRedstone dust = 1 kg (Guestimate)\nFlint = 2 kg\nDragon fragments = 900 kg (Though it depends on the scales) SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGH\nSuper enchanted Egg = Not even enough to matter - only around 75 kg\n\n\n\n\n\nSome suggested contenders:\nYeeti sword\nT12 Perfect\nWood singularity + Foil\nMastiff armor\nPigman Sword\nBackpack of Gold\nT11 Gold minion\n\n\n\nWe'll talk about the rest of the inventory later.\n\nRight now, it's all about the heaviest item.\n\nYeeti Sword What? You're literally throwing stuff.\n\nThe recipe for the Yeeti - I mean Yeti sword is pretty complex and expensive.\nIt requires 9,830,400 ice and 819,200 iron ingots, plus a Hilt of True Ice, which we'll just calculate as another ice piece.\n9830401 * 919 + 819200 * 874 = 9,750,119,319 kg.\n\nT12 Perfect (Chestplate)\n\nTier twelve perfect armor is the best defense set in the game.\nHowever, since this is a single item, we're going to calculate the chestplate.\n\nOne T1 Chestplate has 8 enchanted diamond blocks. We have to tier that up 11 times, costing another 44 enchanted diamond blocks, or 52 total.\n52 * 25600 * 390 = 519,168,000 kg. That's less than the Yeeti sword.\nThe rest of the set is also pretty heavy.\n(176 + 24) * 25600 * 390 = 1,996,800,000 kg. Even though it's close to the Yeti Sword, it's still not the best. (Besides, we can't use it due to it taking up more than one slot.)\n\nScorpion Foil + Wood Singularity\n\nA wood singularity is a strange item that can be anviled onto a wooden sword - and the heaviest wood sword in skyblock is the scorpion foil.\n\nOne log is 200 kg, and we need 320 of each enchanted type, plus the two enchanted stacks in the scorpion foil.\n(320 * 6 + 128) * 160 * 800 = 262,144,000 kg. Dang, not even close to t12.\n\nFull Mastiff armor (bork)\n\nMastiff armor not only requires a lot of resources to make, but those resources are also naturally heavy.\nThis site shows the material requirements.\nYou need:\n245760 logs\n20480 diamonds\n102400 gold ingots\nAnd 2048 wolf teeth (not counted)\n\n(245760 * 800) + (20480 * 390) + (102400 * 4727) = 688,640,000 kg.\nThis means it's slightly better than the T12 perfect chestplate alone in terms of weight. Not good.\n\nPigman sword + Stack of enchanted pork\n\nThis item seems to keep popping up in this series, but it's never quite the best.\nA porkchop weighs 300 kg. There are 25600 in one enchanted cooked porkchop, and 48 of those in a Pigman Sword.\n272 * 25600 * 48 = 334,233,600 kg. That's better than mastiff armor, but not close to anything else.\nIf we turn it into a stack, we nearly reach half a billion kg.\n272 * 25600 *64 = 445,644,800 kg. Still, that's worse than the T12 chestplate.\n\nBackpack of Gold\n\nThis is obviously a Jumbo Backpack, since it can store the most items.\nThere are 54 slots in a backpack, and 64 items in a stack.\nEnchanted gold blocks are, without a doubt, the heaviest base item in the game (Base item = Only crafted with versions of itself).\nThere are 25600 gold ingots in an enchanted gold block. The leather in the backpack is math ugh how can I not do it not heavy enough to be counted\n54 * 64 * 25600 * 4727 = 418,214,707,200 kg. I've also calculated the mass - 104553676800 - and no it's not a black hole.\n\nYet.\n\nHowever, there's a better option than a stack of enchanted gold blocks.\n\nBefore, we determined the weight of the Yeti sword to be 9,750,119,319 kg. What if we put those in the jumbo backpack?\n\n9750119319 * 54 = 526,506,443,226 kg.\n\nNow that's more like it.\n\nT11 Gold Minion\n\nGold is notoriously heavy in real life. In Skyblock, one ingot is around 4727 kg.\nA gold minion requires 364,592 ingots to become T11.\n364692 * 4727 = 1,723,899,084 kg. That's around a sixth of the weight in the Yeti sword.\n\nThat means that the Jumbo Backpack is the best. Alright, the backpack is the heaviest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever.\n\nI don't know why no one has ever considered this before.\n\nMaybe it's because they assumed that you can't hold it, and therefore doesn't have weight.\n\nStill, the Gold minion is a minion.\nMinions can collect and store resources.\n\nYes, that's right. Even though we can't pick it up, the Gold Minion T11 can store more items inside it and in its large storage, which also is made up of wood, another heavy resource.\nAdditionally, we can put up to 64 other fuels, 2 upgrades, and a hopper.\n\nA gold minion has 960 storage slots, and the XX-Large Storage gives it another 1728.\nLet's let the gold minion fill up all the way, and have it carry the full 2688 enchanted gold blocks.\nWe also have the XX-Large storage (unfortunately, confers no more weight than a Large storage), which is another 256 enchanted logs, each at 128000 kg.\nWe also have the Enchanted Hopper, costing 12800 iron ingots to make, each at 874 kg.\nThen, there's the question of upgrades. Super compactors are obviously the best for this, as it's 7 stacks of enchanted cobble, and one enchanted redstone block.\nFinally, we have the fuel. Plasma buckets are best for this - even though you can only fit one in, it's still better due to the sheer amount of resources in it. It requires 8 lava buckets, with 51200 coal (25 kg) and 480 iron (874 kg) each.\nLet's add it up.\n(4727 * 25600 * 2688) + (256 * 128000) + (12800 * 874) + 2 * ((7 * 64 * 2515) + 25600) + 8 * (51200 * 25 + 480 * 874) = 325,337,961,600\n\nDid I just hear the laws of physics break?\nYou literally can place these down on top of each other. I don't care that Skyblock is a floating island, it should literally snap into pieces when you place these things down.\n\nHowever, we can safely say that the single heaviest item that we can carry is a jumbo backpack full of Yeti swords.\n\nOnto the inventory part.\n\nFirst things first - the regular inventory and ender chest.\n\nDue to the community center update, you have now have up to\n\nThe ender chest can have up to 405 slots, with the normal inventory having 35. This leads to 440 total slots.\n\n526506443226 * 440 = 231,662,840,000,000 kg. This also would cost you 146,564,000,000 coins. We're just getting started, even though this is already far beyond what a normal person could afford. We're around 5 times Vanessa's net worth.\n\nDid you know that you can also carry backpacks on your head, and put them in the wardrobe?\n\nIf we buy MVP+ for our Steve, they can carry up to 19 extra backpacks. Of course, now we need to figure out what the other armor pieces are going to be.\n\nWe've already figured out that t12 perfect is the heaviest armor set, so let's calculate the bottom three pieces.\n151 * 25600 * 390 = 1507584000 kg.\n\nAdding that to the backpack, we get a total of 526506443226 + 1507584000 = 528014027226 kg per armor set.\n\nWe can carry 19 of these.\n\n528014027226 * 19 = 37937108000000 kg. \n\nOnto the pets menu.\n\nFor ... reasons, we're only using the first page of the pet menu.\n\nThere are several pets, but unfortunately there's none that can be crafted with gold.\n\nLet's consider some options.\nZombie pet\nPigman pet\nWither skeleton pet\nWolf/Ocelot pet\nSheep pet\n\nZombie Pet\n\nThis is one of the more expensive pets, requiring 8 zombie hearts to craft, each of those costing 256 enchanted rotten flesh, each of those costing 160 rotten flesh.\n\nRotten flesh, like pork, absorbs the weight of the thing that it drops from.\n\nFor some reason, I can't find the weight of a corpse. It's almost like no one wants to weigh a dead person.\n\nPeople can be so strange.\n\nLet's just say that it's around 40 kg, and continue on with maths.\n\n40 * 160 * 256 * 8 = 13107200 kg. We can also upgrade the epic variant at Kat to double the weight, as it costs another 8 zombie hearts. 13107200 *2 = 26214400 kg.\n\nThe egg is actually so light (~75 kg) that including it won't matter whether we include it or not.\n\nPigman Pet\n\nA Pigman pet costs 8 enchanted cooked pork chops to craft, and another 8 to upgrade at Kat.\n\n600 * 25600 * 16 = 245760000 kg. This is pretty good!\n\nWither Skeleton Pet\n\nThis is bound to be a decently heavy one. A wither skeleton pet costs 8 enchanted blocks of coal, and another 8 at Kat.\n\n25 * 25600 * 16 = 10240000 kg. That's a 24th of the pigman pet weight.\n\nWolf & Ocelot Pet\n\nWhy is wood so heavy? It's literally 200 kg per block - then again blocks literally hover in this game. Riiiiiight.\n\nFor this crafting recipe, we need 16 stacks of enchanted wood.\n\n16 * 64 * 200 * 160 = 32768000 kg. This is better than the zombie, but worse than the Pigman, which is still in the lead.\n\nSheep Pet\n\nMutton is the same weight as wood per item - 200 kg - and the crafting recipes are the same, except wood is now mutton.\n\nJust to be sure, let's check.\n\n16 * 64 * 200 * 160 = 32768000 kg. Yep, they're the same.\n\nGriffin Pet\n\nThis one shouldn't even be able to float at uncommon rarity, it's that heavy.\n\nGriffin pets are a very special type pet that use upgrade stones instead of Kat to upgrade their rarities. Those upgrade stones are freaking expensive, especially in gold.\n\nThe feathers and claws are, well, feathers and claws. They don't weight much. Ignored.\n\nOnto the actual math part.\n\nFor each tier of upgrade stone, you need the previous tier to use it, and the previous tier of that, and so on. This means that for a legendary stone, we need to have used an uncommon, rare, and epic stone before we can even use the legendary variant. Annoying - except that this also means that we get a lot of weight. \n\nThe total cost for the legendary variant of griffin (here) states that we need... *wolf whistles* [WIP] gold ingots to make the legendary version. If each gold ingot is 4727 kg, then\n\n4727 * 3276800 = 15489433600 kg. How do you even carry these thin- *pspsps* What? Oh yeah, physics literally jumped off an island.\n\nSo the heaviest pet is the Griffin pet. What pet item should we add?\n\nA Tier boost is one of the most expensive pet upgrades, but unfortunately it's not that heavy. We can see when the endstone protector rises up that it's full body is only around 25 blocks of endstone, which is around the same weight as cobble.\n\nIn the end, 2515 * 25 = 62875 kg isn't much, but it's an option.\n\nThere's actually a very unusual way to get more weight on our pets. We're only using mob drops if we can figure out the weight of the mob, i.e. a wolf talisman is the weight of a wolf.\n\nDid you know that Jello's actually kind of heavy per square meter?\n\nThe exp share core can drop from any mob in the deep caverns. If we kill those giant slimes and get the drop, we get around 1000 square meters of jello, in an item. And one square meter is 1141 kg.\n\nWe also get to craft it using another 11520 gold, which further increases its weight.\n\n1141 * 1000 + 11520 * 4727 = 55596040 kg. I believe we've found our pet item.\n\nOn one page of the pets menu, there are 28 slots. All we have to do is add the Griffin Pet and the item, right?\n\nNot exactly - I've actually been forgetting this for a while. You can pinata your pet (the black cat's already a pinata) by stuffing it unwillingly with candies, and from that point forward will always have candies inside of it.\n\nThe best candy to use is the superb carrot candies, as they're the highest tier. You can get higher from the community center, but that actually just decreases the weight.\n\nSuperb carrot candies are very expensive, costing 2 mil a piece. The crafting recipe requires you to have 544064 carrots and 682.6 gold ingots. Carrots weigh around 70g - not much, but it's something.\n\nWe can pinata our pet with ten candies. (I hope you feel as ridiculous reading that sentence as I was writing it.)\n\n(544064 * 70 + 682.6 * 4727) * 10 = 413111302 kg. The pet is now significantly heavier.\n\nLet's add everything up and multiply it by the 28 slots.\n\n(413111302 + 55596040 + 15489433600) * 28 = 15,958,140,942 kg in the pet menu.\n\nOnto the accessories!\n\nThe probable best bet is to find an accessory with a lot of gold.\n\nThis may include:\n\nHunter ring\nRed claw artifact\n\nLet's start with the Hunter ring.\n\nIt requires an extremely high amount of gold, but unfortunately isn't tiered. Instead, there's just 256 gold teeth and a grizzly bait, which is just the weight of a wolf.\n\nThere are 32 enchanted gold ingots in a golden tooth - the wolf teeth actually don't matter, as in total it's less than a kilogram per golden tooth.\n\nTherefore, per golden tooth, there are 32 * 160 * 4727 = 24202240 kilograms of gold.\n\n\n\nIn the Hunter ring, there are 256 of these.\n\n24202240 * 256 = 6,195,773,440 kg. Decently heavy. We've only passed the heaviest weighed object (2,204,458 kg for the Kennedy space station) by a few orders of magnitude. Nothing too big.\n\nThe Red claw artifact is slightly different, as it's a tiered accessory. The final tier requires (listed here) 317,440 gold ingots, 92,160 leather (remember, the cow's weight gets sucked into the leather), 7944 wolf teeth (only around 3 kg), and a red claw egg.\n\nLet's do the math. 317440 * 4727 + 92160 * 2100 = 1,694,074,880 kg. That's ok, but still 5 times less than the hunter ring.\n\nTherefore, the Hunter ring is the best accessory for our purposes.\n\nWhat about reforges?\n\nUnfortunately, there are no really good reforges for our purpose, since the three accessory stone reforges are silky (spider web), molten (lava), and bloody (mmm), we don't have many choices that weight much.\n\nTherefore, it doesn't really matter if we use a reforge or not in the long run.\n\nSince the recent community center update, you can now hold up to 55 accessories with the largest size.\n\n6195773440 * 55 = 340767539200 kg. This is fine - oh, and if the effects stacked, we would be getting over 3x combat exp with a combat exp boost III.\n\nOnto the quiver.\n\nUseless, as the best we can hold is around a stack of meter cubes of lime jello because of the slime bow.\n\nOnto the fishing bag.\n\nThis can actually hold items that are heavy - not that anything's really wrong with jello.\nThe probable heaviest item is the enchanted cooked salmon, with 25600 regular salmon inside. You can also hold up to 45 stacks of items in the fishing bag.\n\nOne salmon weighs around 26 kg, so 26 * 25600 * 45 * 64 = 1916928000 kg. That's a lot of flesh. (link in signature smooth plug)\n\nWhat about the sack of sacks?\n\nMining, of course, is actually the best for this. (gasp sign turns on) Foraging was second best, as you can hold a lot of logs, which are around 800 kg each.\n\nThings you can hold in this that really matter:\n\nCobblestone = 2515\nCoal (One) = 25\nObsidian = 2600\nDiamond = 390\nIron = 874\nGold = 4727\nIce = 919\nEnd stone (around half of cobblestone's weight) = 1250\n\nAdditionally, the sack costs coal to craft - 17920 pieces, to be exact. You can hold 20,160 of each mining item in it, so...\n\n2515 * 20160 + 25 * 38080 + 2600 * 20160 + 390 * 20160 + 874 * 20160 + 4727 * 20160 + 919 * 20160 = 243,376,000 kg.\n\nThe foraging sack is close, but not entirely there. 4800 * 20160 + 800 * 17920 = 111,104,000 kg.\n\nYou can upgrade your sack of sacks 5 times, each giving you 2 extra slots. (If you do upgrade it first before anything else, I know where you live) In total, that's 22 slots.\n\n22 * 243376000 = 5,354,272,000 kg.\n\nFinally, we have travel scrolls.\n\nWe have MVP+ (oMG P2w TWaveL scWOlLs) already due to the wardrobe slots bonus, so we can consume every scroll (the only epic scroll that really matters is the hub crypts though)\n\nWhat travel scrolls are there that need resources?\n\n- Spooder den\n- Hell\n- Eternal darkness area where you kill people for their eyeballs\n- Legal deforestation and animal petting zoo where you kill animals, along with a very very rich person who can summon rain yet lives in a shack in a forest.\n- Prison server (Now with Technoblade jokes)\n- Bigger prison server where you can also slice random jello blobs who just wanted to hug you (not their fault that they weigh over 500 kg)\n- Place to tear up a farmer's crops\n- Place to destroy a carefully crafted (pun absolutely intended) ecosystem\n- Crypts containing dead people who were buried, showing that someone cared for them.\n\nSkyblock is a fun and wholesome game!\n\nLet's go in order.\n\nThe spooder scroll requires 128 enchanted flint, which we know weighs 2 kg per. The enchanted eyes of ender don't weigh enough to matter.\n\n160 * 2 * 128 = 40960 kg. Hmm.\n\nThe scroll to Hell is just a bunch of ... dust?\n\nThat weighs literally nothing?\n\n160 * 0.5 * 128 = 10240 kg.\n\nAh, here we go. The scroll to the zooper men area requires a lot of enchanted obsidian and end stone (which is just cheese).\n\nWe know that obsidian is 2600 kg per, but what about the end stone?\n\nWell, it says here that a cup of shredded cheese is 4 ounces. This means that in total, there are 16904 ounces in a cubic meter of cheese. (479 kg)\n\nWe need 48 enchanted obsidian and 80 enchanted end stone to make the scroll, so...\n\n48 * 2600 * 160 + 479 * 80 * 160 = 26099200 kg. Much better.\n\nWhat about the gold mine prison server scroll?\n\nYou need a lot of heavy materials for this one - 48 enchanted iron and 90 enchanted gold. Iron is 874 kg per ingot, and gold is 4727 (I will never forget that number after this thread)\n\n874 * 160 *48 + 4727 * 160 * 90 = 74781120 kg. Saaaaaaay... What's the weight of the gold mine, anyways? (Might do that next)\n\nThe deep caverns scroll is less expensive in terms of weight, requiring only 48 enchanted redstone dust and 90 lapis lazuli. For the redstone dust, I'm just going to assume that it's around 0.75 kg per (since it's dust). The Lapis is also slightly heavier at 3 kg apiece.\n\n48 * 160 * 0.75 + 90 * 160 * 3 = 48960 kg.\n\nThe barn is a peaceful island where a farmer lovingly created his ranch, planted crops, and terraformed the mountains to hold more seeds. Then, every early game player comes along tearing everything up and slaughtering all of his animals. This game is fun and lighthearted!\n\nThe barn scroll is relatively cheap as well, costing a small 48 enchanted carrots and 90 enchanted potaters. Both of these... uh... huh... one sec. *googles What kind of food are carrots and potatoes* Ah, here we are. Both of these vegetables don't weigh much and are around 100 g each (0.1 kg).\n\n128 * 160 * 0.1 = 2048 kg. Pretty disappointing.\n\nThe park is deforestation area number one in skyblock, but luckily it's a magic(k)al park with infinite growing trees and a bunch of people who want your cash for their gain.\n\nThe actual scroll is only 128 enchanted birch logs.\n\n128 * 160 * 800 =  16384000 kg. Nice.\n\nFinally, we have the hub crypts scroll.\n\nThe crafting recipe is moderately expensive, and requires 90 enchanted obsidian and three revenant viscera (which essentially weighs nothing).\n\n2600 * 160 * 90 =  37440000 kg - that's our heaviest one.\n\nThere are also other scrolls we can use, but they aren't crafted.\n\nWhat about...\n\nThe trade menu?\n\nHear me out, I know it's not very conventional. You aren't holding the items in there. They're not even yours.\n\nHowever, with a booster cookie, you can have the opportunity to buyback backpacks full of yeti swords from the trades menu, adding another 540 yeti swords to the pile at 28431348000000 kg.\n\nI think that's it. *ahem* TALLY TIME\n\n28431348000000 + (37440000 + 16384000 + 2048 + 48960 + 74781120 + 26099200 + 10240 + 40960) + 5354272000 + 1916928000 + 340767539200 + 15958140942 + 10032267000000 + 231662840000000 = \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkeep scrolling nerd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfine\nAll I wanted to do was spend some time with you.\n\n\n270,490,610,000,000 kg.\u200bOk I took way too long on this, sorry for the wait.\nLike, comment, subscribe follow.\n\nOr gib soul\n\ntl;dr it's not a black hole but it shouldn't exist in your inventory without you dying instantly (and hopefully getting double deathed to save the server)"

    "body": "Slayers are getting a little bit boring because it's just calling Maddox, killing wolves, spiders, or zombies and claiming exp.\nSolution : A new Slayer Mob\nLet's keep on grinding these slayers.\n\n1: The new boss\nThe new slayer boss could be a skeleton boss, I introduce to you the Spectral Bowman. Every slayer boss has a place where you kill runts to fight the boss. In the wilderness, there is a place where skeletons spawn, I suggest revamping the place to look like a pervious training ground of archers and knights and keeping the skeletons there. The player kills a certain amount of skellys and fights the spectral bowman. The place where the skeletons spawned could be turned useful instead of just dead weight. The new area would also have a place underground similar to the crypt in the graveyard. This place is where you can fight stronger forms of the skellys above ground but it also minimizes the amount of mobs you have to fight before fighting the slayer boss, similar to the crypt ghouls.\n\n2: Possible drops\nA new armor set would be introduced that is helpful especially when fighting skeletons and this new slayer boss. It would be called Knight's armor. There are two stages, apprentice knight armor and royal knight armor. Apprentice knight armor require Slayer level 3 to wear and is a rare drop (about 1/25). Royal knight armor requires slayer level 5 to wear and is an upgraded form of apprentice knight armor. In order to upgrade the apprentice armor to royal armor, you would need to obtain the Hardened stone that is a 1/100 Spectral Bowman drop. Combine the apprentice piece with one hardened stone and you obtain the royal knight armor.\nA new bow which is a PrayRNGesus drop from the Spectral Bowman. It is called the spectral bow (creative right), it has +200 damage, + 75 strength, +14% crit chance. Similar to the mosquito bow stats, it is a little worse but has a much higher crit chance.\n\n2b: Armor perks/abilities\nShrug it off: 2% chance to deflect hits while wearing Apprentice Knight Armor, 5% chance to deflect hits while wearing Royal Knight Armor. This minimizes damage to only 30% damage for the hit if it is deflected.\nToughened up: 7.5% chance for arrows to bounce off your armor if fired at you. Only applies to Royal Knight Armor.\n\nSkilled flight: 25% chance for the arrow to fly faster and deal 20% more damage. Applies to Spectral bow.\nBarbed arrow: If pufferfish is in quiver bag, arrow stays in the wound and causes 1% loss of health per second over 3 seconds. Only applies to Spectral bow.\n\nIf you have any suggestions, leave them below."

I never thought that I would spend a year on a forum site, or a year in a specific sub forum. The skyblock forums. The young 2019 skyblock forums, ****posting was a rarity, and scam posts ravaged the land, I would hand an L to every scam post that had entered my vision. It may sound toxic but 2019 Zhirst was a lot nicer and na\u00efve than I am now. I even carved myself a little name by being called in lobbies and getting partied by people asking if I was the real Zhirst. It was a simpler time. You had people like @Slayre or multiple members from DND roaming around. November 2019 arrived which would be the month in which I would receive my first (and currently only) Forum ban. Early 2020 arrives and in February so does a forum update, multiple people including me didn't really like the new update, following this I had quietly disappeared for 2 weeks. Returning I had seen people like Quaglet and @MlecznyHuxel99 explode in popularity which would soon lead to the new era of the forums, or current day forums as I call it (I separate the skyblock forums with 2 eras, old and new). With the early days of the new era I had dropped my gimmick of saying or posting the picture \"L\" because I got bored, people started whining about being toxic, and scams seemed to die down for a bit after money trading. Although scam threads are still present. After returning I had also noticed that most of the people that I used to talk to had started to leave and/or disappear.\n\nUseless Fun Facts:\n\n1. My name is pronounced Zhurst\n2. I technically broke a rule joining when I was 12, but i turned 13 a month after so it technically balances out\n3. I used to go by Coolchristo (very glad I came up with Zhirst)\n4. I used to enjoy skyblock\n5. I used to be a moderator in Skyblock Gods which is like a Top ten guild now (and then went to skyblock forceful then quit cause I got bored of Skyblock), but yea I used to moderate it, although I'm not really associated with the guild anymore you should still probs check them out.\n6. I've been scammed more than once, why yes I am an idiot\n\nNow the reason you're here\n\n\nSpoiler: Reveal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, that's all i wanted to say. You can ask me other stuff if you want to. But anyways here is to 10k"

Most of the catches aren't worth it, the only ones that are worth it are Hunk of Blue Ice, Grand Experience Bottle, Titanic Experience Bottle, Guardian Pet, and Squid Pet (The fairy gear is useless and more of a flex, so I didn't include it). That is only 5 out of the 26 available Catches. The coins that you can catch are useless; I can get more with a Raider's Axe farming Enderman, Zealots, or Crypt Ghouls for 5 minutes than I get out of the coin catch which is a 3% for less than 10k coin, and less than 1% for 10-20k coins.\nMy Proposal is that the admins buff the items or amount of items with fishing levels. For example, if I catch an enchanted iron at fishing level 1, I only get 1 enchanted iron, but if I catch one at fishing level 26, I can get 3-5. Coins also scale the same way."

    "body": "The beauty of skyblock is that you can get so far without competition.\nI used to play sweaty games like League where all that matters is getting ahead of everyone else and I HATED IT. I love skyblock because all you have to do is play and you are guarenteed a high position within the communnity. You don't have to constantly follow the meta, you don't have to tryhard competitions if you dont want to, and you can just relax and play skyblock. This is because skills are capped at 50, slayers at 9, etc. Caps make everything less stressful because you know that you'll eventually get there if you just play.\n\nNow... you have to sweat farming. Really??? And from the image I noticed, its literally top 5. Not top 5%, but top 5. That's disgusting. Out of over 100k active players, the top 5 are guarenteed to macro. wtaf were the devs thinking on that one??? Not only are you forcing everyone to sweat farming (because obviously so many people are going to try to get the top spot), but by making the bracket so small you pretty much force everyone to sweat for absolutely nothing.\n_________________\n\nAnd this goes back to something that I noticed a lot recently -- the devs are forgetting why they do/don't do things.\nRemember how spooky events used to only give the rewards to the top 1? Yeah they had to get rid of that because it wasn't fair to people who sweated their *** off just to get absolutely nothing. But apparently they must have gotten some new devs that haven't been playing the game for that long, since they CLEARLY didn't learn anything from that ****show.\n\nAnother example is the new tier of overflux and rev. To be clear, I do like these additions. However, we were going to have a slayers v2... what happened? It gets scrapped and finally now you're bringing the stuff out? Why did it even get scrapped in the first place then? Do you guys even remember slayers v2???\n\nand my last example is with new farming changes and the builders wand. Macroing has historically been one of the biggest problems in skyblock. They had to make it so that killing mobs on your island doesn't give combat xp... but now they made it so that you can literally afk farming by holding down 2 buttons, and then made farming contests where only the top 25 farmers get loot. DID YOU GUYS LEARN ANYTHING FROM THE PAST YEAR? No you haven't. \n__________________\n\nI appreciate a lot of the devs' work and I love the game but it really does seem almost like the old devs are gone and replaced. So much is being added that clearly shows that they learned nothing from the game's past.\n\nI guess that no one read this whole thing but thanks a lot to those who did, and here's a tl; dr for those who didnt:\n\ntl;dr\nat least make it percent based not position based. Position ranking aren't fair at all when macroers exist and the playerbase is so big."

    "title": "Skyblock Idea, The Shielding Sword",
    "body": "I just had an idea about making a new sword in skyblock. It would be called the shielding sword. You would get it from the dark oak collection at collection 8 (instead of the exp that you would usually get), and you would craft it with a golem sword, two stacks of enchanted dark oak, and 3 enchanted iron blocks. The recipe would be so expensive because I thought it would have a unique ability called Summon Shield. It would be an ability that would be activated after right clicking it, the ability would cost 75 mana to use and would have a 15 second cooldown. The ability would summon a wall of particles that wouldn't let and mob get within 3 blocks of you for 5 seconds. If the mob can hit you from outside the circle then they would only do half damage. I think this sword should be of epic rarity if it were added into the game. Also, the stats of the sword would be a +175 damage and +50 strength sword. It would give +50 defense while holding too. Sorry I don't have any pictures, I just had the idea and didn't know how to model it. Thank you for reading! Please comment feedback if you have any suggestions."

Anyways, this isn't really a real \"update\", and I just want to say that the Skyhistory API has been changed first of all. Please read the Skyhistory spoiler if you want to know more about the change. I also am working on an armour viewer, the only problem as of now is the NBT decoder, as I can't find a good working one for PHP. The project would also be switched to use NodeJS instead of PHP in the near future (if I am not that lazy), and making a lot of things would be easier for me. Finally, I made a updater.sh file to update to the newest version of the project when run and automatically migrate all the cache/history files. Thats all I updated, expect more updates in the future as I just completed CS50x which took a lot of time. Hope you guys are having a nice day/night and stay safe.\n\nLink: http://xworldtechnology.com/skyblock/\nGithub: https://github.com/nullminer/Skyblock-API-Viewer\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Skyhistory\n\n\n\nhttp://xworldtechnology.com/skyblock/history.php?uuid=<UUID>&timestamp=<TIMESTAMP>\n\n<UUID> is the UUID of the player who you want to query, and the optional field <TIMESTAMP> is the timestamp of the player's profile history that you want to query. If you leave <TIMESTAMP> empty, the API will return the list of timestamps that has been archived. Errors are now also better, they are now in JSON format.\n\nUUID_INVALID means that there was no <UUID> field given\nPLAYER_NO_HISTORY means that the player has no archived profile history\nTIMESTAMP_NO_HISTORY means that there is no history at the requested timestamp\n\n\n\nPlease leave a like if you support this project!

The new update implements new spooky mobs that spawn in massive quantities in certain parts of the map at correct times (7pm-7am). My strategy abuses this by utilizing the new ability on the bat pet (2x damage to spooky mobs) and a pumpkin launcher.\n\nTHINGS YOU WILL NEED:\nsword (preferably AOTE for quicker movement)\npumpkin launcher (approximately 1000 ammo)\njingle bells\nlegendary bat pet\nfull bat person set (as many wise pieces you can have for the AOTE teleport ability)\n\nSTRATEGY: \nSo the entire point of this strategy is to find a lobby with as few people as possible (usually it is good to search a couple minutes before the event starts). Between the times of 7am and about 6:40pm you need to farm crypt ghouls (farming revenant slayers during it but it will slow you down). When it hits 6:40 you want to start going to the wilderness. You should be at the bridge to the wilderness at 7pm where you should use your jingle bells to attract as many mobs as possible and kill them using your pumpkin launcher.at about halfway to the fairy pond there is a huge witch spawn area where you can farm them. You should farm until they despawn which is when you should return to the crypts. All you have to do is repeat this and you should have a guaranteed skeleton horse pet.\n\nGOOD LUCK TO ALL..."

We lost 4 million coins, most of our minions and many items worth value, if I were to put an estimate on how much money we lost in total, I would say we lost about 10 million coins, and as a solo player at this point, that's a-lot of coins.

Many people are saying these rewards are too exclusive but heres why they are not.\n\nIn the leak five other events are shown next to the one Minikloon was hovering over. This means at least 25 people (There may be more events hidden or not developed yet) can get the best rewards from the event every year. Now these rewards are very obviously only good for a farming 50 player. There are less than 1000 people currently at farming 50. It will only take around 6 months for every farming 50 to have gained these rewards at least once. That really isnt too long. You also have to realize that a lot of farming 50 players may be inactive or uninterested.\n\nTldr: These rewards are very exclusive but they're meant for a just as exclusive group."

    "title": "Tank: An Analysis, A Proposition, and A Cry for Help.",
    "body": "Hello everyone. I'm someone who is quite opinionated and I see a lot of threads about Tank and that it is the worst. Gold star to you guys. But I feel like people don't take a proper look into why it is the case. I've wanted to tackle it for a while. This is a warning that this is a fairly long read. Also there isn't a tl;dr. Don't look for one.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSpoiler: Disclaimer\n\n\n\nAs a start to this thread (Which will likely be buried quickly because if it isn't a meme thread, a sh*tpost, or a flame war, threads instantly die), I want to add a disclaimer that I am by no means the best player. I am Tank 23 with Catacombs 22, I work full time and don't get to play a lot, and even when I am home, I play other things a lot. I don't use the absolute best gear that you can, I don't use the best pets, and I certainly don't do things efficiently, as if I did, I would be playing Healer instead. This is all in my opinion, looking at it from my perspective and my experience in games with balancing, as well as my experience as a tank in games.\nThis thread is meant to be an objective look at the role of Tank. The class that has seemingly been ignored and forgotten. Overshadowed in every aspect. And ever since they made some changes to help with aggro on most mobs, it has not been touched. The only thing it has gotten was a pity buff of 30 seconds CD off the Ult, but that really doesn't affect anything. However, is this really the fault of the admins just neglecting the class? Well, technically yes, but it is also far more complicated than that.\n\n\n\nA look at Tank.\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\nSpoiler: Fall Without a Rise\n\n\n\nFirst of all, let's go over what Tank as a class is. The idea behind Tank is to be a wall that your teammates can rely on to help in tough situations that they wouldn't be able to survive. Always leading the charge, not afraid to step out first and pull all the mobs to themself so that everyone else can free-fire without worry for them dying. With many ways to ensure that everyone can be safe, Tank is a class for the people who want to be the beacon of hope. At least, that was the idea.\n\nEver since F3 when people were finally able to deal with Shadow Assassins without getting destroyed, Tank has had virtually no purpose. People are more interested in grinding XP and stats as fast and as efficiently as possible (Topic for a different day), and simply put, Tank has no place in that playstyle. Everyone was able to one shot and clear rooms themselves with ease, and so came the meta of 4M1H/5M. F4 only helped reinforce this, as Spirit Sceptre made Mages even MORE efficient with their clearing. Plus as people grinded more and more (Once again abusing strats to farm XP as fast as possible), they got strong enough that they could tank all the Spirit mobs without needing to cheese with Decoys, even further eliminating the need for a Tank.\nF5 is what I think marked the moment where Tank now has a foot and a half out the door. With a combination of Shadow Assassin Armour, Livid Dagger, and -what is in my opinion, one of the most absurdly poor decisions by the admins (MORE ON THIS LATER)- Dwarf Turtle Shelmet, Berserkers were all of a sudden able to do absolutely everything a Tank could do, while dealing far more damage. I don't feel like this was bad, as it brought Berserkers to a point where they could potentially compete. Then F6 brought Necromancer Lord, which has better stats outside of dungeons than T12. Again, not inherently bad.\n\nWhat all this meant is that ANY class could have armour on par with Tank, and have stats on par with them, all while dealing far more damage. Necromancer Lord allows you to have a personal escort of mobs, and if you make that Super Tank Zombies, well you basically have a Tank on you at all times that manages to draw aggro better WHILE DEALING MORE DAMAGE! If you've ever read Solo Leveling, this to me is very reminiscent of that.\nSo where does the purpose of Tank go from here? People no longer need you to survive, you aren't able to properly pull all mobs. More often than not, I am asking for a Mage to come help me with mobs because I can't clear them fast enough. The only utility that people care about is healing, and Healer does that in spades, WHILE DEALING MORE DAMAGE!! For people who want some fun healing numbers, here.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Healers are nuts\n\n\n\nSo, I will be using the main forms of healing that they have, the Healing Circle. From level 0, this circle heals for 2% of the players max HP/s, or the equivalent of a Mana Flux. From here, this healing is increased by the Healer's Renew Passive, which increases all ability healing by 50%. So now the circle is healing for 3% Max HP/s, which is the same as a Plasma Flux. Also, with the Healing Aura passive, any players within 8 blocks of the Healer receive an extra 1% Max HP/s, so that is now 4%. Assuming that you are using a Zombie Heart, this is all DOUBLED to 8% Max HP/s. If they have a double healing item, that is 16% Max HP/s healing. And this ability is on a 2 second CD. FROM LEVEL 0.\n\nEvery level you get, Renew gets increased by 1%. For every 5 levels, Healing Aura gets increased by 0.1% and Healing Circle gets increased by 0.5%. I think you can see how quickly this gets out of hand. At Healer 25, your circle will be Healing for 4.5% Max HP/s innately, increased by 75% via Renew to 7.9% Max HP/s. Healing Aura is healing for 1.5% Max HP/s, making it 9.4% total. Doubled with Mender item to 18.8%, and then potentially further doubled or more to other players via their items. Basically, around 20% of your Max HP/s. On a 2 second cooldown. Did I mention it deals damage? Oh also I think these numbers can all be doubled if you are the only Healer, but I don't play Healer so I'm not sure.\n\n\n\nThe issues with Tank all come from the fact that Dungeons is not designed with Tank in mind. I think the Admins tried, but it missed the mark, and they have dug themselves into a VERY deep hole with it. At the same time, the player-base has pushed it this way, getting upset when anything potentially even touches Mages negatively. Hell, Midas Staff is just Tank's ability except with a much shorter CD and far more damage, but 100mil so justified(?).\n\n\n\nBreakdown of Tank\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSpoiler: A Rusty Jigsaw\n\n\n\nLet's look at Tank's kit now, because oh god, it is NOT pretty to look at.\n\nAt Level 0, Tank gets 100 HP and 50 Defense innately. They also receive 25% Total Defense per the first part of Protective Barrier. The second part of this is that when you get damaged below 50%, you gain an Absorption Shield equal to 10% of your Max HP. On a 90s Cooldown. Oh and there is a higher chance you get targeted by mobs when you aren't getting blasted by Skele Masters.\n\nSeismic Wave is a wave that goes in a line, dealing damage to mobs it hits. It deals 20k + 10% damage per 50 Defense, which this scaling is probably the best thing going for the class. But then it is plagued by terrible hitboxes, the wave stopping the instant it hits any block (Had it stop on a carpet a few runs before I started writing this), the fact that it can't hit enemies more than 1 block above it, and a 60s Cooldown. Now if you use an Earth Shard, you get a whopping 10s off this, which doesn't make the most significant distance considering you are mostly using the ability to clear out stray mobs that your mages missed while gathering all their loot and coins. I'm not going to bother with Super Heavy removing 5s per piece, as I have seen next to no people running it. Doesn't mean people aren't, but personally I haven't.\n\nNow when you think of Ultimate abilities, you think of a big game changing ability. Archer has arrows galore to absolutely melt any target that dares take reduced KB. Mage becomes Thor incarnate and rains hell on everything. Berserker goes full Austin Powers and has what Reaper Scythe should have been when it was originally released, and Healer gets the clutch save and top-off to everyone to collect their Play of the Game award. Tank gets an emergency \"Oh **** there's a lot of mobs here\" button. I had so much more excitement when I saw the name of the ability considering I am a big fan of Log Horizon, but it feels so boring to use considering I only ever use it when I am the one in danger. The taunt on it is just as pointless, as Jingle Bells does the taunt, just without the 2m30s CD. Not saying the CD should be changed, but it just feels so bad to use in majority of situations. I can only think of one or two times where I used it in a truly clutch situation, and even then, it was to save myself, not someone else.\n\nWell, what is the scaling's per level? All this seems pretty solemn, but surely it gets good scaling's for your dedication right?? Right???\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisappointing is a cheap word for it. 200 damage feels meaningless when the wave scales harder off defense, 10 Absorption HP is actually laughable, and the .2% Total Defense just seems laughable when you look at the fact that the only mobs that seem to be a threat are mobs that deal True Damage. Also 1 Defense per level. 1 F**KING DEFENSE PER LEVEL.\n\nThis doesn't change at ALL throughout the levels. No reduction to Cooldowns, no boost to your HP, nothing that truly seems to matter in ANY sense. It feels like it was all an afterthought. Like the entirety of Tank as a role was pieced together after everything was made. And this feels so ****ty, because even before classes were announced, I was super excited to play the role of Tank. I had the T12 Reaper Mask ready, got my Legendary Turtle, and did the math to figure out what reforge would be best for everything so that I could be the wall my team would need. And quite frankly, my guild still lets me tank for them, but we all know that I am not necessary there. I'm not the saviour I hoped I would be.\n\n\n\nItems will save us?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSpoiler: Band-Aid Fix?\n\n\n\nVery often, when situations like this arise, the easiest answer is \"Well just give it some new items. It worked for Berserker, just do it for Tank.\" I think that putting a band-aid fix like this is not only lazy, but I feel more harmful in the long run.\n\nEarth Shard is really the only Tank exclusive item that you even see, and it is still overshadowed by better weapons, simply because you can already quick cast your ability, and the 10s off the cooldown doesn't really matter. Stone Chestplate and Metal Chestplate are useless because everyone splits up, and Healer already covers the damage issue when you are all grouped up. Super Heavy is alright, but the stats it gives don't compare to the stats that Necromancer Lord gives, so why go it?\n\nUnless the items are made so that they can literally ONLY be worn by Tank, other classes will use them. Perfect has been used by Mage for about as long as people realized that T9 Perfect is accessible at Cata 19. Mender Fedora is a Healer item, but everyone will switch to Reaper Mask anyways at Cata 33, though odds are we have a Mender Superbrain that gives 1500 HP and 2 trillion regen per second, so who cares about that. Necromancer Lord is now being used in the place of Perfect simply because it's better.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Dwarf Turtle Shelmet\n\n\n\nTime to talk about Dwarf Turtle Shelmet. I hate this item. It is everything I feel is wrong about SkyBlock bundled into one stupid upgrade. And no, it's not just me being salty about the fact that my Legendary Turtle is now worse than an Epic variant with the Shelmet on it. It's the fact that it is something literally every class can use to HUGE benefit. Pet items should NOT be this powerful. Giving immunity to KB has historically been very powerful (See Slime Hat bug), and should have downsides to picking it as your big buff. Did you want to have a lot of EHP with lots of Defense on top? Did you want very good damage reduction at a cheap price? Did you want to become the immovable wall that doesn't even flinch at 5 mobs hitting you?\n\nWell why pick! Now you can just put the anti-KB on whatever you want, and get the other perks while you are at it! Hell, why not give your Berserker one, because extra Crit Damage isn't very helpful. Hey, Mage won't notice the 100 Intel from Textbook missing, why not let them get it too! Healer might miss out on their Aura Healing because of mobs, better give them the option of it as well, considering everyone in dungeons at this point already has at least Mana Flux, so Bubblegum is useless.\n\nIt is so infuriating to see that something that was intended to be very limited -but very strong- be given to anyone who wanted it. I went with Turtle because I felt it was the best choice because of the anti-KB. Combine being stubborn, bitter, and very busy with work (Tire season yay), I don't have the time to be able to change, and I don't want to change. I know that Blue Whale w/Shelmet is far better. I don't care. I know that choosing to die on this hill will not change anything, because they can't just remove the item. I don't care. This is what I am passionate about. And I think Shelmet is one of the biggest mistakes Admins have made in this entire experiment with balancing and MMOs.\n\nI am going to cut it off here, because I will be here all day otherwise.\n\n\n\nAny item that has been added that has even slightly catered towards Tank, is either far below optimal, or is used by every other class more effectively. There is a reason that when people ask \"What should I get as Tank?\", people just say \"Just switch to Healer\".\n\nBut this really isn't something that can be fixed. Because of the fact that damage reigns supreme, weapon abilities have to be that otherwise they just don't matter. Because Tank armour doesn't have abilities that aren't centered around their team, it either is an ability that doesn't help much, or it has no ability whatsoever, making it even MORE appealing to other classes. And items? Mana is something that is scarce for me personally, as I only often need to use it for Jingle Bells. It can be a concern with my Ornate, but I have enough Intel on that to cover (Also in those situations, Healer usually ults). So having even more items to clutter my hotbar and make it so that I struggle even MORE with mana is not what Tank is about for me, though I could see others enjoying it, so I'm open to it.\n\nNo, in my opinion, what Tank needs is a rework. The issue is reworking it without changing its name to Bruiser. I can't say I am the best at balance, but I will do my best.\n\n\n\nThe Proposal\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nSpoiler: Class Passives\n\n\n\nI feel like the passives have good intention, so I want to try and keep it fundamentally. I'd say that the permanent XX% Total Defense is okay, but I think that it should also gain either some extra HP per level, or True Defense every other level. True damage is something that should be feared by all, but I feel like Tank should be a bit less scared.\n\nIn regards to part 2 of Protective Barrier, it also seems okay, but it often feels like it appears for no reason. Instead, make it so if a certain amount of damage is taken within a time period, THEN give the Absorption shield. You could also lower the CD to about 60s, or have it get reduced every 2 levels or so.\n\nAs for the Taunt, it just feels completely pointless. If I need a mobs aggro, I am NOT leaving it up to chance. Jingle Bells is this passive but in a convenient form of \"Yes, you get the aggro\". This should be replaced with something I feel like has been suggested for a while, and that is a thorns-like ability. My brother came up with the name Vengence. Contributing to the damage without tripling up on the Taunt aspect, this would make fighting mobs not feel like a complete waste of time. Additionally, any enemies damaged by this get affected by a new debuff: Vulnerability. This debuff would make it so that any damage incoming to them is increased by a % amount while they are affected. You can make it so that the level of the debuff is increased every 10 levels. Numbers could be toyed with.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Dungeon Stone Abilities\n\n\n\nOh Seismic Wave. The potential you had. Especially now that you are essentially improved on Midas Staff, I feel like you feel almost out of place here. I don't see any way to improve this without making it far more powerful, so I'd recommend a different ability. A simple one would be what I would call Shield Bash. You hit an enemy in front of you, knocking them back. If they hit any other enemies when they land, they take additional damage and are stunned for a brief period (FIX STUN PLS). Make this a relatively low CD, around 15 seconds or so.\n\nAs said earlier, I loved that the ult is a reference to a show I love. The character in Log Horizon who plays the Tank role is one of my favourite characters. But it just doesn't feel... like an ultimate ability. It should be impactful, it should be a game changer. So my suggestion is not to remove it, but to give it an upgrade. Taunt all enemies within 10 blocks, but now, for the period that the ultimate is active, any enemies that get within 5 blocks are pulled into you. Instead of being completely immune, you take HEAVILY reduced damage (In the realm of almost invulnerability). This way, you can still proc your passive of Thorns. At the end of the ability, you deal a circle of damage to all enemies, scaling off how many enemies were pulled into you.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Ghost Abilities\n\n\n\nI mean, I don't think much needs to be changed here. Other than making Stun Potion work. Please. It's great that they get to look like they ARE confused, but they aren't actually.\n\n\n\nI understand that it is not perfect. There is lots to adjust, and I don't have the ability to code anything at all to test and make this work. It is all concept. I just wanted to piece together a kit that felt like it had meaning. I had the idea of the Ultimate for a while now, and I wanted to build off of it and make something that feels like a proper class. Criticism is always welcome.\n\nTo the Devs\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nSpoiler: Showing my respect\n\n\n\nAs a closing, I wanted to speak directly to the people who make this for us.\n\nAdmins, you guys are far too underappreciated for what you do. Any time there is new content, it is met with \"w0w worst update ever\", followed by \"omg where is content?\" 2 days later. People rush through everything you work so hard on, and only try to find ways to exploit it to be efficient. And I hate seeing all these threads that say that you have no idea what you are doing, when really, you know better than anyone else what is done, or what needs to be done.\n\nWe aren't going to agree on everything. If we did, I'd be no better than a blank puppet. I admire the work you guys do so much, and even though there are things I strongly disagree with (Shelmet), I respect the hell out of all of you working on this absolute monster of a project. There is a reason there is only one other real Minecraft MMO, and the entire server is about only that. It is a huge undertaking, and you guys have learned so much along the way.\n\nI don't expect Tank to ever be the best. Hell, I don't ever expect it to be better than the worst. But I love playing Tank. I don't want to watch it die out because it seems like there is no idea where to go with it. You guys are taking a break from Dungeons after F7 to allow people to catch up, and to work on other projects. If there is ever a time to look into Tank, I think then is the best time. Who knows, perhaps you have something in line on F7 that makes me look like a complete clown. I hope that you do.\n\n\n\nI want to thank everyone who took the time to read this. It is my passion for this game put out for you all to read, and while I expect that there will be disagreement, I am still happy that I was able to do it. Even finishing this up is getting me emotional, which is silly considering who I am. But I am very grateful to you all.\n\n-Amooseable\u200b"

    "body": "Particularly anybody who's done Tarantula slayers has hated this island, but some people like me hate it even more. In this thread I will tell you reasons why I hate the spider's den and what I would do to improve it.\n\n\nReasons:\n1. The layout of this island is horribly built and consists of too many holes and pitfalls that make your slayer grind even worse\n2. I don't know why people love hitting other people's slayer bosses but it's so annoying to me because I don't get the combat exp and sometimes people will aggro the boss to chase them and bring them to a far away place, kill it, boss drops digested and I have a 2-hour breakdown.\n3. Gravel on this island seems to never appear even though there is practically over 1000 spaces for gravel to spawn (rough estimate)\n\nWhat I will do to improve it\n1. Make this place not have as many holes and pitfalls as well as more places for spiders to spawn\n2. If you know, both Revenants and Svens have two different places to do bosses while Tarantulas only have one, which makes the Spider's Den a nightmare because Tarantulas give profit (I am writing this during the Aatrox event) the most and don't have the annoying critical hits like Revenants and Svens do. I suggest making a high level area for Spiders somewhere in the hub (maybe hidden in the mountains) so that some people can both go to the lower level area for gravel and collections and high level area for slayers (similar to Ruins and Howling Cave)\n3. Make gravel more frequently to spawn. I easily spent an hour getting 50 gravel because gravel spawns like once every 69 seconds. This is important for the noobs out there who are grinding minions so this would be a great help to them (might as well make creeper minions easier to obtain lmao)\n\nThat is all.

This is not too much of a problem other than it means anyone who doesn't have about 200 million coins to spend on killing a golem can't do any damage with even people who can deal 100k damage per hit only getting 3rd or 4th place. All this is not too bad, most people can put up with it, but the worst part comes in most of these people dont actually bother to kill that many zealots and maybe get a few crystal fragments out of it at most. I feel this is unfair to players like myself who have to melee the golem and have 100s of zealots contributed can't ever get more than a few 100k dmg, or even sometimes (in my experience) none at all, meaning the last hour of their time that they spent killing zealots is relatively wasted. I propose two solutions: the first one is just making golems immune to magic damage (damage from mage weapons, such as the midas staff), however this one probably isn't the best option so my second proposal is simply that golems health is increased massively, to maybe 15 million or even 20 million, allowing melee players to get damage in before the golem is basically one tapped by someone with a midas staff or any other method, while still allowing people with such weapons to get their own damage in."

However, ever since I made this account to report a bug I found a few days ago. But when I made the account I could not stop thinking about something very disturbing I saw a while ago. This may trigger some people so be warned. This is not graphic or anything and most likely a rng thing but still shocking. I see these spinning characters every now and again, which I still have no idea why they are a thing or how they are triggered but they circle you like a hallucinations and do 2-3 spins. It's a player model with a skin and name usually. I don't usually catch the name because it appears for a second also meaning I can't screenshot but 1 time when I did I was shocked. The name was Derek Chauvin, and even worse in a police skin! If I am not mistaken this is the man that killed George Floyd and caused mass unrest among the USA. I have theories as to why this could have occurred but all seem to be preventable. First is that there is a pool of skins and already existing names that code chooses from and spawns the ghost. Or similar like takes some Hypixel players name and skin. All of this being so rare that it seems impossible.\n\nI would really like a response for this. It is surprising that the most popular server in all of Minecraft that has all age groups can allow that to be in the game.\n\nPS. I don't want to sound like a \"Karen\" but I think this should be brought up.\n\nEdit: \nThank you for informing that its anti-cheat, but I think its still pretty bad that they use other cheater names which usually have slurs or are inappropriate for the server. I think they should make filters for that or manually remove it."

To not go beyond Lvl 50 skills. You are literally trying to kill your player base at this point. The other perks are fine, but the only thing that this Skill change will...\n\n\n\n\nhypixel.net\n\n\n\n\n\nSo assuming the farming update leak (thread linked above) isn't faked and isn't changed by the time of release, that means farming will now have a cap of 51. The other rewards, the event itself, and everything else the update has to offer aside, I want to focus on the skill cap increase. Based on that thread, I'm guessing it's the popular opinion that a skill cap increase is bad, but why is that? I really don't see why a skill cap increase is so bad.\n\nThe main issue I see with this is people who want to max all their skills having to grind more. Yes, an extra skill level means a couple million more xp needed to unlock, but why is that bad? Skyblock is an endless grind. With a constant flow of new updates, new content is frequently being added, which means you need to grind more to be truly maxed out. I don't see how needing to get new dungeon weapons or needing to recombobulate all accessories is any different from increasing the skill cap.\n\nWhen new weapons were added, people didn't complain about there being new stuff to max out, they complained about other things, like power creep happening too early into dungeons. If you weren't complaining about having to max out a livid dagger after maxing out an aotd, why are you complaining about having to get farming 51 after getting farming 50? The need to grind is no different from anything else.\n\nImo, you really shouldn't be playing skyblock to max everything out unless 1) you're fine with new stuff like this being inevitably added, or 2) you set a goal for yourself that isn't maxing everything out. If farming 51 is added, set a goal for skill avg 50 instead of skill avg 50.125. If not, you're already playing the game to grind. Adding another skill level isn't any different than adding new accessories to reforge and recombob. If you're gonna complain about having to do more grinding, then plead the admins to never update the game past the current point."

    "body": "firstly before i start a few things.\ni wont be think very much about grammar and spelling\nmany of these ideas come from other people but they r not complete ripoffs since i have taken them and changed them\ni wont be using spoilers since i think it gets messy idk why\n\n2020/08/03\n\numm.. the admins will be releasing a update where you elect NPCs...\nCould I get a creative mind??!!!!\n\nwell.. same thing the admins seem to be doing something in style with my Olympic Games idea.\n THE EVENT UPDATE\nthis update is a bit of a mix of diffrent smaller updates and we will be starting whit they mayor system.\n\n\n MAYORAL SYSTEM\nrecently in the lobby remake there was an important change most people didnt notice/ care about. this was the house where seraphine sits. before she was mayor. but this has now been changed to clerk, and outside of the building worker emma talks about the uppcoming election. here is my take on it.\n\nevery 4 sb years ( like 1,5 weeks irl) there is an election. its works like this: the election is just like other evnts but it only happens once every 4 years, and it last for a full season. every 4th year during the full spring season ( yes other events like traveling zoo can take plce during this time) 3 or 5 randomly choosen candidets will be standing on display in the town hall. all of them will be providing certain boost at about the same strenght. if you r online during this event only have to go to the town hall, look at the stats provided and then choose the one they like the most at a npc in the corner of the room. when the season is over all the votes are counted and the candidate whit the most votes wins. as soon as the election is over the boosts a candidate has offered are applied. these will then last for the next 4 years. the buffs can be litrely anything, it could be that all potions last 10% longer or that you earn 5% more exp from all skills.\nas i said earliar ther will be 3-5 candites ( not that it is diffrent from time to time but it deppends on how many possible people there are to be choosen from)\nso there will be an amount of diffrent posible mayors im thinking maybe 10, and lets say 3 can become candites, so it will work a bit like dark auction and traveling zoo. if there are more possible mayors there could be up to 5 candites.\n\nso here are the possible mayors. ( fell free to suggest more )\n\nSPEEDER:\nspeeder loves speed and wants evr1 to experince to felling of running around the lobby.\ngives 50 more base speed and a 10% speed increse. also makes the speed cap 100 higher. whooooooooooooooooooosh\n\nROSE:\nrose is a simple balanced pereson that doesnt like picking sides she does a bit of evrything and tries her best to help others. the only thing she doesnt like is wierdly cosmetics and flowers. its said that this started when she was a kid and her parents forced her to always wear roses, and even named her rose.\nGives a 5% exp buff for all skills. ( maybe 10% if thats to low)\n\nSTAN:\nalways works hard and loves grinding, will specialize in one thing and then grind for days or even week for hours on end. has 3 skills maxed and over 300k zealot kills.\nincreases minon speed by 15% of their base speed. ( is not affected or affects any minion fules, so if a minion as e charcoal it will work 35% quicker)\n\nMORGAN:\na powerful mage that when not runing for mayor. farms dungeons, has one of the highest mana scores in the game. once when playing f4 the secong before the dungeon started all her teammates got kicked, she solod it in less than 10 minutes.\ngives a 10% stat boost to all players in dungeons ( after all other buffs) ( this incluedes all stats) and another 10% mana buff in and outside of dungeons.\n\nDAVID:\nAn archolegist that has been exavaiting dungeons, seems to have uncoverd the dungeon loot system.\nincreases dungeon loot by 10% ( not sure how it would work, but made in a way so if you for examlpe get a recomb evry 50 rounds you now get it ( on avrege ) in 45 rounds)\n\nRURGION:\nA dwarf helped found the farms in the mountain and revolutionised dwarf society. loves farming.\n20% extra fraing exp and 10% more crops.\n\nTANYA:\na barve warrior whit maxed combat and foraging. level 25 berserk ( as of rn will probably increase cuz she clears dungeon 5 hours every day) in her wardrobe she has every single warrior set.\n10% more meele dmg.\n\nLIGHTEYE\nhER arrows will pierce through your heart as She jumps tree to tree. Be wary that at any moment, She can strike.\n+50% arrow damage\n+20 aiming ( also works in dungeons)\n\nBRUCE\nBelieves that all problems must be solved by walking into them, so his skin is as hard as dragon armor.\n+100 defense\n+50 HP\n\nk, so i will add more but dont really have the inspiration for it rn i would be thankfull if people suggest more.\n\n\n THE OLYMPIC GAMES\nSo there also as been another recent update most people havent cared/ know about: coluseum is closed, it was one of the most useless fetures mostly causing lagg. the admins are working on fixing this. but i have an idea:\n\nthe olympic games happen evry 4 years ( 2 years from the ellections ) and any can particapate. this is how it work:\nthe event just like the mayor system takes place every 4 years during the full spring, so more people can participate. when the event starts there is displayed 5 challeges ( and one joke challenge( it still gives the same bonuses but is dumb))\nthey last for the full spring and when its over the winners claim there prizes. ill explain how the prises work in a sec.\nbut first the how does the challenges work.\n\n The Challenges\nso when the olimpic games begin there will be 5 challenges displayed ( and one joke challenge) ill be giving some xamples but there is toons of possibilitys.\n\nDO THE MOST OF IT CHALLENGES.\ncutting spruce wood\nkilling zombies\ndefeating scarf\ndefating sven packmasters\nfarming exp\nmining coal\n\nyou get the point that kind of stuff and there is so many more possible.\n\nJOKE CHALLENGES.\nplace the most jerrys.\ngo trough the most portals/jump pads in lobbies.\nyou get the point, the reason is so that newer players can get a chanse to get toons of money if they just grind. And it would be funny having a bunch of people in lapis jumping in and out of portals for 12 hour straight.'\n\nTHE REWARDS:\nall challenges ( including the joke one) will give equal rewards working like this.\n( the amount of money you get can be changed)\nfirst place: omlympic cup, gold block says your name how much you did that task and first place. you also get 50m coins\nsecond place: iron block, says all the stuff on it. 30m coins.\nthirs place: emerlad block ( idk same stuff ) 20m coins.\ntop 100: gold nugget, named olimpyc medalion, whit your name your placement and how much of it you did. also 10m coins\ntop 1k iron nugget, same stuff 5m coins.\n\nthis is for all the evnts meaning there will be toons of money given out.\n\nTHE AWARD CERMONY\n( the winners will during the award cermony be npc) the winners will stand on pedistals and for each of the diffrent competisons there will be an parade whit npc that have got parts of there skin on. the winners can then claim there prizes at the event master at any time.\n\nTHATS IT\nk so im finnished now, im happy for likes but i would prefer comments so that i can improve this.\nalso sorry for using this: ( ) alot.\nthe last part didnt really fell complete but i dont knwo what more to add.\nty for reading have a great day"

    "body": "Welcome to this thread about how to get good at Skyblock! \u200bThis thread applies to early game players struggling to enter the mid game, But how exactly do we enter this stage of the game, allow me to list a few requirements so you know the goals you need.\n\nRequirements\u200b1. Over 200 fairy souls, fairy souls are extremely important as they can provide a massive stat boost with giving over 400 health, 200 defence and 50 strength, meaning this is very vital for a early game player.\n\n2. Talismans, talismans are also another extremely important aspect of the game, as they provide various stat boosts, talisman are also very useful to have, as you can choose which stat you want to boost by reforging the talisman to your liking. You will need 30+ talismans to be mid game.\n\n3. Armour, for armour your gonna have to have either ender armour, with gp5 and p5 or dragon armour as for dragon armour its recommended to use unstable or young for your first set as they both provide 2 important stats (speed and damage), you can basiccly use any sort of armour as long as you get decent health and defence as well as damage (decent being 600+ health and 200+ defence)\n\n4. Weapon, for weapons you will need one of the following, maxed raiders axe, aspect of the dragons, leaping sword or maxed aspect of the end, other wise your gonna need to be dealing over 13k damage enough to one tap zealots.\n\n5. Minions, for minions your gonna want to have over 17+ minion slots and all your minions that are working being over tier 7, not much else to say about minions\n\n6. Slayers, for slayers i may be wrong but you should be slayer 4 4 4 meaning revenants, svens and taras are all level 4 which is quite a common level for slayers.\n\n7. Networth, networth isnt very important but you should have a networth of over 5mil+.\n\n8. Skill average, sa is very very important as it provides heaps of stat boosts, so for sa you should have a skill average of over 17+, recommended is over 18 sa, correct me if im wrong.\n\n\nSo we just went over all the requirements but how would you reach those requirements? Well there are heaps of youtube videos about it but ill lists a few tips and tricks so dont worry.\n\n\nTips\u200b1. For fairy souls i recommend watching time deos video on all fairy soul locations or fairy soul way points.\n\n2. For talismans you can either purchase them off the auction house or creating them through multiple collections such as emerald collection.\n\n3. Armour, make sure you have a reliable source of money such as zealot farming, potato farming or coco bean farming just make sure you have one to allow easy access to this armour.\n\n4. Weapons, not much to say but again make sure you have a good money making method so you can purchase them.\n\n5. Minions, to unlock minions alot of people upgrade them to tier 5 or 7 by purchasing the resources of the bazaar.\n\n6. Slayers, really something you learn over time or quickly not much to say.\n\n7. Networth, be rich lol.\n\n8. Skill average, this is important so usually you should get mining, fishing, alchemy and enchanting to level 16 then get foraging to level 20 as well as farming to level 20 then combat 18 this will level your sa to 18, to level up farming make sure you set up a full pumpkin farm for easy farming levels, combat just farm rev tier 3 or enderman.\n\nSo most of use want money making methods as they are important so ill quickly list a few.\n\nMoney making methods\u200b1. Potato farming, to set one up you want to have full potato farm, this farm can provide around 1mil an hour, recommended way to farm it is through using a replenish hoe and a personal compactor 3000.\n\n2. Zealot farming, this farming is very overrated and can give around 1mil and hour sometimes 2mil it depends on your luck.\n\n3. Coco bean farming, i myself have created a afk coco bean farm so if you want i can make a thread about it, it makes around 1.5mil an hour.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy, ill be listing more money making methods really soon. Please leave a positive reaction it would be appreciated, have a great day!"

    "body": "this thread is irrelevant lol\nBoss Room\nThe Boss Arena will be a circular shape, similar to Livid and Thorn's Boss Rooms. Sadan will sit on a throne in the middle, surrounded by 4 Eternal Flame campfires that will play a pretty huge part in the Boss Fights\n\nThe Boss Fight\n[Opening Speech]\n[Sadan]\"Well it looks like you adventurers have finally made it down here\"\n[Sadan]\"I'll admit, even though i've killed a Wither, its impressive that you've managed to beat Thorn and Livid despite their immense powers\"\n[Sadan]\"But let me warn you, adventurers. You've made a mistake challenging me\"\n[Sadan] \"Let me show you the power of the Necromancer Lord himself\"\n\n[Winning Speech]\n[Sadan]\"Looks like i underestimated your capabilities\"\n[Sadan]\"I thought you'd be worthy of my True Power\"\n[Sadan]\"Oh Well...\"\nPhase I\n\n\nSpoiler: Boss Stats\n\n\n\n\nHealth25000000Spawn LocationThe Catacombs - Floor VISpecial BehaviourInvincible unless the Eternal Flames are put out\nBeating a Sub Phase in over 90s will make Sadan deal 5%more damage in the next Sub-Phase(Phase 3)\n\n\n\nIn this phase, Sadan will charge, dealing Huge amounts of Damage towards the nearest players and shoot fireballs dealing True Damage at farther players. Mobs named Sadan Followers will spawn and try to swarm the players. Unlike other bosses, Sadan is invincible against all damage, and only is vulnerable when all 4 Eternal Flame Campfires are put out. Campfires will ignite themselves 20 seconds after being put out. Once Sadan reaches 15000000 HP, he will teleport back at his throne and summon his Forcefield, meaning that Phase 2 has started\n\n[Phase Transition Speech]\n[Sadan]\"You adventurers were stronger than i thought\"\n[Sadan]\"But i wont let you have the advantage!\"\n[Sadan]\"My Spectrals will take care of you\"\n[Sadan]\"Go forth, my Spectrals, and obliterate those who oppose the Wither Slayer\"\nPhase II\nDuring this phase. Sadan will remain stationary at his throne and to advance to the next phase, the players will need to defeat a wave of Spectrals in under 2 minutes or else Sadan will revert back to Phase 1, with a 10% increase in damage.\nAll Spectrals has 33% Magic Resistance\n\n\nSpoiler: Undeads\n\n\n\n\nMobsHealthSpecial AbilityDefiled Spectral5000000Poisons you for 2000 Hp/sFiery Spectral8000000Ignites players dealing 1500 Hp/s and slows them downEnder Spectrals10000000Teleports at players and deals 10% more damage than other SpectralsArachnid Spectrals2500000Is the fastest of all the Spectrals. Shoots webs at players every 10s, slowing them down by 20%\n\n\n\nIf you managed to beat the horde of Spectrals in under 2 minutes, you will advance to the Final Phase.\n\n[Phase Transition Speech]\n[Sadan]\"Looks like my Spectrals aren't strong enough to hold you adventurers down\"\n[Sadan]\"But dont underestimate someone who isn't afraid to lose everything to prove who's best\"\n[Sadan]\"I will now merge with my Eternal Flames and be stronger than ever\"\n[Sadan]\"Now, its time to show you my True Power.\"\n\nBut if you didn't managed to beat the horde in under 2 minutes, you will be greeted with a special message and Sadan will revert to Phase 1\n\n[Special Message]\n[Sadan]\"You fought well but it looks like you're too late\"\n[Sadan]\"I'm back and this time i'll defeat all of you with ease\"\n[Sadan]\"This is where your journey ends\"\nPhase 3\nIn the Final phase, Sadan will regen back to full health and will go through 5 Sub-Phases every 5m HP Sadan loses, each Sub-Phase representing one boss fought before. Spectrals will also still spawn, although at lesser rates than Phase 2. \nSub-Phase 1\nIn the first Sub-Phase, Sadan will try to run away from the player while shooting Fireballs at players, dealing True Damage. Every 25s, he will teleport to the center and shoots Fireballs at every direction, each Fireball dealing 2x the damage. After he loses 5m Health, he transitions to Sub-Phase 2\nSub-Phase 2\nIn Sub-Phase 2, Sadan will spawn 4 Spectrals, each has 8mil Health and representing a Dungeon Class. While the Spectrals are alive, Sadan will recieve -50% Damage. Every 30s He will shoot Soul Sand projectiles at the Player who deals the highest damage to the Spectral. After he loses 5m Health, he transitions to Sub-Phase 3\nSub Phase 3\nSadan spawns 4 invulnerabe Spectral Guardians and each will try to shoot a Laser Beam at the players. Sadan himself will try to melee players, targeting Healers. After he loses 5m Health, he transitions to Sub-Phase 4\nSub Phase 4\nAfter Sub-Phase 3, Sadan will become invincible and his Spectral Undeads are replaced with Spectral Bulls, Spectral Chickens, and Spectral Wolves. Every 5s, a Spectral Sword will spawn at the center. Hitting Sadan with his Spectral Sword will take down 2.5m Health. If a player misses, the Spectral Animal's damage will be increased by 8% each time\nSub Phase 5\nIn his final Sub-Phase, Sadan will produce 3 Clones of himself, each having 5m Health. Killing the wrong one will Heal the other Clones by 25% Max Hp and increase their DPS by 5%. After his Health drops to 0, the Boss Fight is finally over\n\n[Ending Speech]\n[Sadan]\"You finally did it, huh. You've finally beat me\"\n[Sadan]\"Look like my time here is over...\"\n[Sadan]\"But beyond these doors lie unimaginable evils known as Withers\"\n[Sadan]\"I mean, i've beaten one before, but i dont know if you got what it takes\"\n[Sadan]\"They've been growing stronger and stronger since i first fought them\"\n[Sadan]\"I'm warning you adventurers, you will be ripped apart by these evils\"\n\"Sadan's body explodes into a fiery mess and his throne is destroyed.

There craftable, they're easy to get, and they make almost the same amount of money compared to a snow minion. \nAlthough snow minions will be the better one over time, clay minions are so much better for starter to mid game. \nBut I guess Skyblock is always about spending a butt ton of money to get slightly better stuff. \nWhat do you guys think"

    "body": "So you may we wondering, why do you want 99 million ink sacs? Well it's simple. It's for the memes.\n\nThere's only 1 way to get inc sacs that doesn't include the bazaar and that's fishing. The fastest way to get our sacs is to go fish in the park.\n\nAssuming we use full shark armor, legion V, a legendary dolphin pet, etc. we can get a 100% SCC which is really good for us. Though we will need to use spiked bait so no bonus speed (tell me if I'm wrong).\n\nFrom my personal experience in the park with rain I was able to get squid 19 in 20 sea creature catches and assuming we can get 1 reel every 5 seconds then we should in essence get 1 squid every 5.25 seconds.\n\nBest case scenario is that we get 3 ink sacs per squid. However night squid exist too and can give up to 27 ink sacs. From my experience I've gotten 1 night squid every 15 squid so that means we get roughly 5.5 ink sacs per reel. Now time for the division.\n\n60/5.25*5.5 = 62 ink sacs per minute\nAdditionally 1 squid spawns roughly every 30 seconds and if you get a friend to kill it for you give you the loot we get 68 ink sacs a minute\n\nNow lets say we have some friends that kill our squids for us and they have a level 100 legendary squid pet. Now we basically get 136 ink sacs a minute!\n\n99,000,000/136/60/24/365 = 1.38 years to acquire 99 million ink sacs.\nNot bad. It's a respectable speed. If you sold this all to an NPC that'd be 198 easy million coins.\n\nThis was incredibly stupid. Why did I do it you may ask?\nTo simply have fun which is what the forums should be about lol.\n\nThanks to @M00N & @Dumplingsushi & @RemButMasterWarlord for helping refine the calculations"

(Each player who deals 100 or more damage gets their own set of presents.) \n\nThe issue that people like we what an answer to is, can we hog the cannons for the whole event and leave our presents on the floor the whole time and pick them up when the event is over and its pointless to sit on the cannons anymore?\n\nThe answer is YES, you can sit on the cannons for the WHOLE event and your loyal presents will be there waiting for you for at the end of the event. No one an pick them up and they will not despawn. \n\n\n\nSpoiler: Proof\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\nHowever...\n\nBe careful...if you disconnect or leave/change lobbies, your presents will vanish and you cannot get them back.\n\nSo, armed with this knowledge..Go, and hog the cannons to your heart's content."

    "title": "[Idea] How to add legal armor dyeing (Bits/Fire Sale) {Effort Post} [16 positive reactions]",
    "body": "So what the heck am I talking about? \nI am suggesting to make ether a bits based dyeing system or based off of fire sales(maybe exclusive rank only cosmetics). Why would it cost gems, bits or a rank. This would be a 100% cosmetic update and Hypixel is like most companies for profit. This would boost their sales at no cost to the player base.\n\nHow dyeing would work\nEveryone wants to dye their armor different colors because well its cool and some people don't like the color of their armor. Here are a few ideas on the how to make a system work. First I am going to lay out a few ideas on how you would actually change the armor's color.\n\nTheir could be an item when combined in an anvil changes the color of the armor piece to a pre set color or a player selected color\nA pre set color would set the armor to that color\nA player selected color would allow the player to choose what color they want. You can buy an un-dyed armor dye and then select the color. (Maybe: once the color is selected you can't change it)\nThis would work like combining any item in an anvil. armor + item = new color item.\n\nThe second way that dyeing armor could work would be a cauldron that when opened has a unique Gui that allows the user to select the color.\nThis could be per placed in a location(I would pick the flower house because its very related)\nThis could be an item bought that allows people to dye armor\n\nHow would a player be able to use these items\nIn this section I will talk about each type of item could be obtained and used. Starting with the most \"expensive\": Fire sales\n\nFire Sale: per selected item dye\nThis item could be set for what armor piece it goes on. For example you can put the Pink Superior Dragon Helmet dye on a sup helmet or it could be called the Love Superior Dragon Helmet dye. This method of having armor colors linked to a fire sale exclusives head skin is very nice because it allows the devs to make cool changes to armors while having them be matching.\n This item rather than being for just one armor piece could be sold as a set.\nOr it could be for any armor and it changes the color. \n\nFire Sale: user selected item color\nThis would work in a similar fashion to the per selected item dye. You can buy it thought the fire sale and apply it on an armor piece. The major difference here would be that it wold not be for specific armor pieces but rather for any armor that can be dyed.\n\nBit Shop: Selling armor dyes in the bit shop could be both per selected dyes or user selected colors(Or even both)\nThis wold be very similar to the current enrichments. There would be a dye in the bit shop and when clicked on it would open up a dye menu with a more expensive custom color selector and cheeper per selected colors(both ideas can work)\n\nBit Shop: Selling the dyeing cauldron in the bits shop.\nThe cauldron would be used to select custom colors for your armor. Might might even cost a pretty penny(like reforges)\n\nRank exclusives: The cauldron could be a rank exclusive item that you can buy or it might even be placed in the flower house.\nIt wold cost money to select the color.\n\nFree but limited by rank: The cauldron in the flower house could be used to have limited access to color changes. This would be like rune crafting where you can kinda do it but you are restricted. Defaults would have access to a small amount of colors.\n\nHow to prevent scams?\nA prevailing issue with endless amounts of player selected colors could be how people tend to scam. To over come this issue with potential scammers the ah and the trade menu will show the armors true color and it will have a tag on what the dyed color is too. Another solution to this would be to have it when selling on the ah(and maybe trade menus) the color of the armor resorts back to its original(standard) color. Trade menus should have the color removed unless trading with your coop mate because you don't just casually drop your sup chest for them to try on.\n\nTLDR: Legal armor dyeing. Buy from bits shop or fire sale so Hypixel makes profit. Read the actual thing if you want to see how that could be implanted.\n\nFeed back is appreciated. Also plz give reactions\n\nEdits(probs misspelled things) :\nEdit 1: had a not in the wrong spot\nEdit 2: asked for reactions."

    "title": "[Suggestion] Necromancy Overhaul",
    "body": "Hey there!  xTear here!\nI've been pretty absent from the forums, but I'm making my return with a mega-thread about an absolute overhaul to necromancy. Now, what is necromancy? Well, at the moment, pretty much nothing because it's so useless. Right now, there are like 3 good souls to summon, Sup LA, FA, and the Exalted Inquisitor. However, I was unhappy with those choices pretty much an hour after release and decided to start drafting up a much better version for souls. This was what I came up with:\n\n\nSpoiler: Frozen Adventurer no.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut... as cool as that was, it got pretty much no reactions except a few likes. So, I decided a few days ago to start compiling a huge suggestion thread with different mobs (A LOT OF THEM), easy buffs/changes to current gear, and a few menus to make things cleaner/have better QoL. All of these have received very positive feedback, so, I decided to reach out to the forums community and see what you all think! I will split this into 3 categories, mob changes, gear changes, and QoL. This is because I feel like necromancy is the most underrated and overlooked skill, and the amount of potential it has is incredible. Without further ado, enjoy.\n\nLet's start with the mobs! I put ages into making these, and I hope you like them!\n\n\nSpoiler: Common Mobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyeah I only added one, you guys don't care about commons you wanna skip to the good ones\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Uncommon Mobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(again I made less of these because you prefer to see OP ones)\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Rare Mobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand now to all the cool ones,\n\n\nSpoiler: Epic Mobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Legendary Mobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Mythic Mobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Supreme Mobs (yes i added supreme ones lol)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhew! So I basically just redid the mob soul info thing which previously looked like this,\n\n\nSpoiler: old info description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto look way better, give more info, and also give abilities to many of the mobs you would think would do something. This way, nothing is useless anymore, and the abilities you think would work, actually work.\n\nMoving along to gear changes, you may have noticed that the mobs which I edited had this new cool feature saying \"Left click to add to Soul Inventory\" or \"Left click to add to Soul Bag\" (I haven't made up my mind yet on which I like more). This Soul Inventory is a viewable menu in your skyblock menu, which has a various amount of slots. (Default 3, upgradable to 9 for 100k per extra slot). From this menu, you are able to save, store, and rearrange what souls you want and where you want them. Different items still are limited by how many souls they can individually store (with the exception of having Sadan in your necromancer item, as it increases the capacity by 1). When you move a soul from a weapon to your soul inventory, you can click them from your soul inventory and assign them to any necromancer weapon in your inventory with space available, or delete them forever (with a confirmation for epic rarity or higher of course!)\nNext, I redid the summoning ring. In my opinion, the summoning ring was the most damaging item that could have been added. It basically made Reaper Scythe and Necromancer Sword absolutely worthless. For those who don't know, a summoning ring allows you to pick up mobs regardless of what you kill them with so long as it is in your inventory instead of needing to kill that mob with a necromancer weapon. As nice as this is, it buried scythe even more, and ruined the necromancer sword. I propose that the summoning ring still eliminates the need to kill something with a necromancer weapon, but I think it shouldn't be able to hold souls. Additionally, I made it a dungeon accessory. Here is my redone version.\n\n\nSpoiler: Summoning Ring v2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor current Summoning Rings that have OP mobs in them that people want to use, it will continue to show souls, but you will not be able to summon them. Clicking on it to use them will only show its soul menu and prompt you to either delete or move them.\nNext, I propose a complete redo to the necromancer armor ability. Instead of increasing the damage (pretty useless), it should give a full set bonus total buff to all souls stats by 10%. This way, the armor is useful. Additionally, upgrading with Sadan fragments (dropped from Floor 7 watcher) will make this set bonus +15% to all soul stats, and it will buff the armor to base mythic, which can be recombolulated to Supreme! I do think that the armor should increase the number of soul slots in different necromancer items still. That's a great feature that should stay.\n\nQoL Changes:\n1. Limit to a maximum of 8 souls spawned at once between all necromancer items.\n2. Give Necromancer Sword a +50% Higher Chance to find Souls from Mobs. (1/100 becomes 1.5/100)\n3. Give Reaper Scythe a +25% Higher Chance to find Souls from Mobs. (1/100 becomes 1.25/100)\n\nAnd that brings us to the end of my latest post! Thanks so much for reading! What do you think about it? Feel free to leave a comment below! \u200b"

It involved placing saplings with a builder's wand and then farming the trees that grew.\nToday, many of us awoke to see this message.\n\n\n\n\nThis was an unfair removal.\nThe builders wand did everything it was supposed to. Placing saplings was an intended feature.\n\nUnlike Ghast Farming, which was macroable, this was not. It took effort to build the farm, plant, and destroy the trees. I see no reason for the admins to remove this as it is has pretty much the exactly the same effect as a Replenish enchanted hoe had on farming.\n\nBring back Sapling Placement.\n\nEdit: I'm going to try to spread this as much as possible so there's a bigger possibility admins can see.\nMy message to admins: Please consider reversing your shadow deletion of sapling placement, it harms more people than you think, it invalidates hours of effort. A nerf would be better received.\n\nEdit two: I'm going to add suggestions for nerfs here so that maybe admins will reconsider adding it!\n@Sir_Bacon_2020 suggested to keep it in the game, but nerf the exp gain.\n@Kashapo suggested to not nerf the exp, but instead make the saplings grow slower.\n@Athyestic suggested that the trees grow according to the Terraria rules, such as: \" There must be at least three open tiles between two Saplings or only one will grow into a tree. \" so that there are not as many trees."

    "title": "One of the new hardest items to get in Skyblock is a hoe.",
    "body": "With the addition of the new specialized hoes/axes, farming most crops has become much easier. Nearly all of the crop types have a specialized tool, one of which being wheat. As of 0.9.11, you can get the Euclid's Wheat Hoe, of which there are 3 tiers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Highest Tier Euclid's Wheat Hoe.\n\nHang on, what are those haybale-looking items in this recipe? Those happen to be Tightly-Tied Hay Bales, which can be unlocked at 100k wheat collection. Each of those can be crafted from 144 Enchanted Hay Bales. Since the recipe requires 256x of the Tightly-Tied Hay Bales, the recipe requires 256 x 144 or 36,864 Enchanted Hay Bales. Including the 256 Enchanted Hay Bales needed for the 2nd tier, you would need over 37,000 Enchanted Hay Bales to craft this item. As I am writing this thread, Enchanted Hay Bales cost approx. 15,000 coins each on the Bazaar. Some quick multiplication will tell you that in order to buy all 37,000 Enchanted Hay Bales needed to craft this item, you would need over 550 million coins. For reference, most of the Legendary Ender Dragons on the Auction House are under 200 million coins. That's an expensive hoe.\n\nOkay, so you probably won't be buying the materials to craft this item anytime soon. Instead, how about you manually farm the wheat. That shouldn't take too long, right? Let's go back to our 37,000 Enchanted Hay Bales. Each Enchanted Hay Bale is equivalent to 144x standard Hay Bales. In turn, each Hay Bale consists of 9x wheat. 37,120 * 144 * 9 = 45.1 million Wheat needed to craft this item. If you were to break 20 wheat crops per second, and on average you got 10 Wheat from each of those crops, you would have to spend over 2 and a half days straight farming for all this wheat. More specifically, this would take you 67 hours to do. And unless you are a high farming level, with a high level Legendary Elephant I feel like 10 Wheat is a generous estimate.\n\nBasically, if you want the Highest Tier Euclid's Wheat Hoe, you'd either need to spend over 550 million coins on it, or spend close to 3 IRL days grinding the materials to make it. Either way, it's hard to get.\n\ntl;dr: The highest tier wheat hoe would cost over 500 million coins to make, or take 2 1/2 days to grind for. Basically, it's expensive as hell."

    "title": "The Story of Scarf [Effort Post]",
    "body": "This is the 3rd part of my alternate timeline for the Hypixel Skyblock dungeons lore that will eventually be turned into a megathread (If I don\u2019t get bored of writing these or nobody cares)\nThe Watcher: https://hypixel.net/threads/the-sto...-reactions-effort-post.3487549/#post-24884507\nBonzo: https://hypixel.net/threads/the-story-of-bonzo-5-positive-reactions-effort-post.3494435/\n\nA bit of Scarf's backstory: Scarf was just a child when The Calamity happened. He had just gotten a red scarf from his mother whom he loved dearly. When The Calamity happened, Necron found him and took him under his wing and made The Professor teach Scarf the dark arts.\n\nScarf just killed a group of puny adventurers and put them in crypts to resurrect. He though to himself that this was a crazy idea but it might work. When the next group of adventurers came they thought it was going to be easy as some of their friends said but they had no idea what was coming. \n\nScarf revived all of the old adventurers from their crypts and then realized that it was still just as easy for the adventurers. He also realized what Bonzo's problem was. The humans didn't ever have to fight the undeads, they just targeted Scarf or Bonzo. Scarf decided to try to learn an invulnerability spell, making a shield that fully protects him from the humans. It worked so he used it on the next group. The adventurers here were usually enough to kill Scarf, but they didn\u2019t know that Scarf had grown stronger. Scarf's undeads turned the adventurers from living to dead in a few minutes as they tried hitting Scarf but couldn't. The undeads kept hitting the puny humans. Eventually, the humans realized what Scarf had done and tried to fight their way out of it. But it was already too late. The undeads were also now using the humans gear against them, magic, healing, archery and swordplay. All skills that regular undeads didn't have. The humans realized that this was the last thing they would do. Scarf abandoned the old undeads, as they came from a weaker group. He took the new adventurers and put them in the crypts. Now he could beat some of the parties that beat him before.\n\nHe started seeking revenge and told his master, The Professor, who sent his message further to Thorn, who said that he could be in the test fight that The Watcher tested the adventurers on before sending them to the boss room. Scarf was happy with that and went down to floor 4 and put a weaker copy of himself on his floor. The Professor also passed the message to Livid who trained Scarf to be even stronger who now made 2 copies of himself and put one on floor 2 in the boss room, and one to be revived by The Watcher on floor 4.\n\nJust a quick end note, I have one run on F3 where I wasn\u2019t really paying attention to what was happening so the lore might start to be not so good anymore. I have never seen any videos of the Thorn fight or the Livid fight, but I have seen a few of the Sadan fight. It might be difficult to have good lore for Maxor, Goldor, Storm and Necron, considering those floors are not released yet. I have never even tried F4 or F5 in general cause I'm a noob. Anyway if you enjoyed it please give it a bump and a positive reaction. When I finish writing the lore for The Professor it will be linked here --->\n\nEdit 1: Formatting"

    "title": "entirety of skyblock summarized in one sentence #2",
    "body": "Yeah that's right, we're doing this again boys, entirety of skyblock summarized into one compact, grammatically correct, run-on sentence with more commas than my number of wins in bedwars, also the reason why I'm doing this again is because from the last time I did this, there's been a lot of updates and stuff so here we gooo: so you may have heard of this minigame called hypixel skyblock, it's a very well known minigame with an extremely active forums and stuff like that, so, hmm how should we go about this summary, well first let's go over skills yeah that sounds right, so skills are basically this set of leveling systems where you do certain tasks to level up your skills; there are many types of skills like combat (stabby stabby mob, or pierce them with ice shards, or shoot arrows at them, etc just ruin their lives as a whole and you're good to go), mining (pickaxe break ores, that's literally the simplest skill), foraging (tree chop chop), fishing (magical fishing mechanics; fish up mystical sea creatures and stab them, or just fish up pre-killed fish, that's fine too), enchanting (do some enchanting stuff like anvil-ing and yeah), taming (level up pet stuff I guess), farming (get crops, easy), alchemy (brew some potions that are completely useless since there's the god potion item), runecrafting (get glowy rocks, make cooler glowy rocks), carpentry (do the second half of the term \"minecraft\", just like 14 million times), and dungeoneering (do dungeons), probably more and I'm just unaware of the update but it's like I'm going to go on google and check or anything, no, all of this is coming from my brain, my very small and limited yet somehow still functioning brain, anyhow, we are going to go over the islands now, so we begin with the private island, where people spawn, chop down a tree for foraging level one (that one tree is something you'll never see again, that is NOT A NATURAL TREE), maybe break some dirt, bridge to the other island, talk to some villager boi, meet your first slave, get the materials for your first cobblestone generator (water bucket and lava bucket, two essential items for the original skyblock map SIKE, you can buy them from a merchant for like 32 coins), ignore said materials for the cobblestone generator, walk into the portal, and then you log onto wynncraft (yes, I had to put a Technoblade reference here, otherwise people lose interest assuming they haven't done so already, which is pretty dumb since this is only like, what, 20 lines of run-on sentences, nah, this is fine), and next we will go over the hub: an island full of NPCs, most of which are useless (be honest, who's ever talked to that one NPC, yeah you know who I'm talking to, I see you reading this post, NPC, you can't hide from me, go crawl back in your house where you belong, that's right, you're useless, man, no one likes you), and tons of completely normal original skyblock items and mechanics such as wheat plots that infinitely plant more wheat, same thing but smaller versions for potatoes and nether wart, an enchanted forest filled with regenerating trees and log piles (some of which spawn with rails and ladders), a coal mine location with tons of free rocks and tiny black fuel units (all infinite by the way), and other places which we'll go over, but this was simply a summary of the hub, oh yeah we're spending the next eight paragraphs on the hub, yes I plan to make this thread EXTREMELY long so buckle in your seat and watch, so let's do this chronologically first, when you jump through the portal from your private island (you can actually save the bridging part and just do /hub, it's really easy in my opinion), then you are told to talk to 12 different villagers which are scattered through the map, you can go over to the builder's house place and claim your first weapon, a golden sword which upon right clicking, you get a small speed boost at the low low cost of HALF YOUR MANA (only for the beginning, once you get more intelligence, you'll have more than 100 mana, it just consumes 50 mana which since I'm a math major, I was able to run extraordinary calculus related mathematical calculations and discover that 2*50=100 therefore it's half your mana so does that answer your question for the three people who wanted to know), uh where was I, oh right so you talk to the 12 villagers which I'm not happy with the location of one of them, you know how there's a small pond between the auction house and graveyard and how there's a small area there with a few benches (almost put a question mark, that would ruin my plan), well it turns out that there's a villager there that you have to talk to so that's pretty dumb I would say, anyway, once you talk to all the villagers, you get a few hundred coins, then you can talk to George the Pet scammer (seriously he buys a legendary ender dragon for like 500 coins shake my head), then talk to Kat (she's underage so shut up about her jeez so many weird people), then you can do many other things, there's a ton of side quests here which I'll just call them whatever I want since they don't have a real \"name\", so firstly, the banker quest, you put coins into the man and boom you're done, then the auction house guy, you just talk to the Auction Master or his 4 identical friends, and boom you're done, then you can go over the forest where you get 10 logs and give it to the lumberjack who gives you an iron axe that can give you apples upon breaking logs, then you can go to the graveyard, talk to the bartender first, then kill 10 zombies or so, talk to him again, then he tells you something about you being good at fighting aka hitting slow, easy-to-hit mobs like 4 times in a row, then introducing you to Maddox I think, then his drug store, then you can go to the coal mine where you can mine 10 coal, talk to the blacksmith, get a random reforge for 10 coal, and other than that, I'd say that there's not much else to do on the hub for now, but since I'm only going to cover the hub once, might as well talk about everything, so you may notice that in the hub and most of the other islands, there's a ton of fairy souls, which you can press on to collect, then each 5 of them, when talked to Tia the Terrorist Fairy, you get stat boosts that total to around +4% speed among other things, in the wilderness, another thing in the wilderness is the Dark Auction, owned by an illegal smuggler named Sirius, hosted by him and his two bodyguards Bob and Bob, they sell tons of random stuff including a golden sword with great money capacity, a flower placing slave, several glowing books that are totally recyclable, a few useless animals, a golden shovel I think, a few player heads disguised as stat boosters, and other things, also there's the Community Center which is slightly less illegal, it's run by this clerk named Seraphine (who used to be the mayor, got demoted, probably because a couple investigators were able to catch her red handed after seeing her yoga room in her house), and every few months or a year in skyblock (I don't remember), they have 4 or 5 (I think 4) mayors that you can elect to be the new mayor, all giving special buffs or events, including fish girl, fish girl v2, rich guy who added like 100 billion coins to the economy, mining boy, dungeon boy, mythologic griffin girl, and more to come, now let's cover the other annual events, including Oringo the Travelling Pet Trafficker (this is a joke but not really, either way, admins please don't ban me), who sells random pets for massively compact stacks of foodstuffs or wood and items and of course, tons of coins, then there's the Fear Mom guy, I have absolutely no clue how to spell his last name (maybe Mongeror or Mongreror I have no idea), who sells some random stuff for candy dropped from horsemen, bats, and other mobs, also there's that one Jerry event thingy too where you have to help support Jerry and his duped stan accounts and also their massive gift piles (that you can't damage yourself, pretty mad), from an annual invasion of magma cubes, magma humans, and several larger magma cubes that take exponentially longer amounts of time to kill, also if you get yourself a snow cannon then it's literally a guaranteed top 5, meaning you get a free like 1 million coins from the event (maybe not 1 million coins but still you get PAID), and then there's the baker guy who gives away free cake to everyone (the cakes used to look pink but now it's a dull red, also I'm talking about the SPECIAL tag thingy, I have no clue why they changed the color, it looks weird now, speaking of things being changed to look weird now, can we take a moment to remember tarantula armor before it was changed to just being normal black leather armor, the old half chainmail thing looked cool now it looks bad), so yeah, I think that was the hub, I think I should mention a few more locations then we're going to start talking about the other islands, first thing I want to talk about is the one tuxedo guy who sells overpriced black leather armor, then the blacksmith guy and his friend who sells overpriced player heads, also the other girl person there who handles all the rune stuff, I don't know her name, also there's a few merchants who sell around 640 of each item per day, the Bazaar where you can buy and sell tons of stuff, the Builder who has an anticlimactic house, a redstone guy underneath him (which doesn't really matter since redstone is very limited on skyblock), and the wool weaver who now sells glass and terracotta and stuff, and I think that's about it for the hub, probably a few other things like the fisherman, Sirius's brother, that one dude with the hacker skin who sells you a reduced time personal bank item, etc but I'm going to ignore those since they're not important, so next we will go to the coal mine, go through the slimy launch pad, and go to the gold mine, where you can mine cobblestone, stone, iron, gold, and coal, meeting four new NPCs, the Janitor who's only good for his 100 coin Telekinesis enchant (0 anvil uses), the lazy miner guy who lost his pickaxe, tells you to go get it, and doesn't even care about it after you find it, then there's two merchants who sell gold and iron, a fancy sword with trashy enchants, gold armor, and chainmail armor, then you get mining level 5 and you go right on over to the deep caverns, where there are multiple floors starting with the Gunpowder Mines, where you battle invisible creepers that do 0.2 damage, mine everything you found in the Gold Mine, and then go to the next floor, the Lapis Quarry, filled with Lapis Zombies that seem fine but then they laser damage you for half your health and then spawn directly inside of you so yeah, you can also get lapis here, hence the name, next you can go down to the Pigman's Den, where there are many many pigmen who act weird since not only do they agro onto you when you hit them or their friends, but you also get attacked by them when you mine redstone near them, which is somewhat flawed as well since universal anger is a thing (when they're beating up some other guy, that other guy leaves, so they're like \"oh we're still mad\" so they beat you up for no reason), and you can, of course, get redstone here, next floor is the Slimehill where you can fight slimes that deal 10 blocks of knockback and have trash hitboxes, and you can mine emeralds, next is the Diamond Mine place thingy, where you can mine diamonds and fight stupidly overpowered zombies and homing bow skeletons, then below that there are diamonds, diamond blocks, and obsidian but in exchange, more stupidly overpowered zombies and skeletons to beat you up, and yes, you can get lapis armor and miner armor from here, both of which aren't amazing but aren't terrible either (just too rare for what they're worth), and then there's the lift operator dude who lets you go from floor to floor upon unlocking them, you can also get superboom tnt in the gunpowder mines for much cheaper than you can in the dungeon hub, which I'll talk about later, anyway, and while we're on the topic of the gunpowder mines, fun fact, you can shoot arrows blindly and if you have aiming on your arrows, they'll hit the invisible creepers, so that's pretty nifty, I would say, also that's all for mines, the rock pet I'm going to cover later in the pets section (assuming I remember to talk about pets), so yeah, next OHH I FORGOT the community center, I only covered the mayors and I forgot the magical steroid cookies that cost real life money to be bought, otherwise you use the bazaar but not like that's an option for ONE HALF OF THE AVAILABLE SKYBLOCK GAMEMODE OPTIONS, anyhow, the cookies make it so you can 1) fly on private islands, 2) not lose coins/potion effects on death, 3) get bits now and then, 4) allows you to do /ah and /bz from anywhere (access auction house and bazaar), and a few other things I'm forgetting, also these cookies caused SO MUCH drama on forums, people were like \"ooh hypixel is promoting irl trading omg\", yeah, so speaking of bits, there's also a bit shop where you can buy a ton of different items with bits, things include Kat Flower (reduces Kat upgrade time by 1 day), Builder's Wand (basically build things faster), God Potion (24 hours of all potion effect buffs), and more, so yeah, now let's talk about the graveyard, so you kill some zombies, they can drop potatoes and carrots occasionally, then you can go to the spider's den, where here, you can find many different species of spiders, silverfish, skeletons, slimes, and occasionally (once every hour), a Tarantula Broodmother miniboss spawns on the top of the den and drops a spider related talisman (the boss is pretty overrated, you can probably one shot it with your fist if you're good enough), and you can do tons of slayers here which I'll talk about later (assuming I remember to do so), then from this Spider's Den, you can go to either the End or the Blazing Fortress, so let's cover the latter first since the End is a very expansive topic, so the Blazing Fortress is the embodiment of hell but it's forty times less scary, once you get decent equipment then you have nothing to be scared of, once you are in this nether location, you'll meet several new mobs, including the upgraded Zombie Pigman (we met them earlier in the Pigman's Den, except this time, they're clothed), who can drop flaming swords which are utter garbage since they just have a built-in fire aspect which no one likes, also you can find and mine glowstone, netherrack, nether quartz, and nether wart here, also there's some Wither Skeletons that have a chance to drop enchanted coal/charcoal (going to cover enchanted stuff in a bit, again, assuming I remember it), and a few of these Magma Cube things that seem fine but then they shoot fireballs at you even after you decapitate them (wait hold on, how do you decapitate something that only has a head), and there's also Ghasts that spawn during the early morning, also there's a boss that spawns here called the Magma Boss, spawns every 2 hours I think, and it's the hardest boss in the game, extremely difficult to kill and requires maxed dungeon equipment to even scratch, and it drops overpowered items, SIKE it's literally weak, people kill it with a couple homing bat bombs, and they drop some useless items, also they used to drop Ember Rods (remember these) which are known for two things: one being one of the OG endgame weapons and two being the leading cause of your entire storage room to be exploded, but now it's discontinued, you can't get it anymore, anyhow, I think this is a good moment to talk about minions since I forgot about them earlier (yes, look at this essay structure, it's terrible), so minions are slaves unpaid workers who work for you 24/7 and generate their corresponding resources, there are many types of minions that can all be unlocked in their unique methods, generally you need to collect a certain number of the resources to unlock that corresponding minion, exceptions include the Flower Minion (obtainable only through Dark Auction), Snow Minion (obtainable only through gifts), Revenant/Tarantula Minion (obtainable through slayer levels), and yeah, minions have 2 minion upgrade slots, 1 fuel slot, 1 automated shipping slot, 1 minion skin slot, and an inventory that can be extended by leveling up the minion, and doing so also increases the minion's speed, hence, amount of items outputted, and upgrades include stuff like diamond spreading (around every 10 resources collected, it will give an additional diamond for free), compactor (compacts items to block form), super compactor 3000 (compacts items to enchanted form), flycatcher (increases speed), minion expander (increases speed except you need more room for your minion now), etc, also you can use orbs that buff minions within a certain radius, but these external buffs only work when the minions are loaded in, meaning you need to have someone afk on your island for these buffs to work, and other buffs are from certain pets, which I might as well talk about now, so pets are small companions that are generally floating heads that give certain buffs to the player, you can craft most of them and others are obtained through rare drops or buying from Oringo or Sirius or Diana, and all of them besides the Griffin pet can be upgraded (assuming they're not the legendary rarity) to the next rarity by using Kat, giving certain materials and coins then waiting for a few hours or days, and yeah, a few notable mentions include the Ender Dragon pet (obtained through EXTREMELY rare drops from dragons), Phoenix (extremely extremely rare drop from any mob besides zealots I think), and of course, the best pet of them all, Jerry pet (grants negative intelligence and absolutely no buffs), so yeah, that was it for pets, I think, oh right, you can craft most of them using two different items, the enchanted egg (used for crafting common/uncommon/rare pets), or the super enchanted egg (used for crafting epic/legendary pets), so yeah, where was I, oh right, so we covered the Blazing Fortress, now let's cover the End, which is a massive island filled with, of course, endermen, and also featuring several NPCs, one that wants you to race for a youtuber's foot, one that wants to sell you overinflated materials and books (seriously, remnant of the eye for several hundreds of thousands of coins, you gotta be kidding me), and there's a ton of mobs including, as I said, endermen (comes in different types, 4.5k health endermen, 6k health, 9k, or 12k or possibly 13k I don't remember and these guys are called Zealots which we'll get to in a second), overpowered endermites, homing bow wielding watcher mobs (they wear the summoning eyes on their head yet they don't drop them), and obsidian defenders (super fast annoying little mobs that give you wither effect and useless rare drops including a shirt named after some heavy dark rocks that can be bought from the auction house for 2 coins), and of course, there are blocks you can mine here, namely endstone and obsidian, both of which have a chance to be glowy, meaning you can mine them for rare items including mana 3 potions, archery 1 potions, coins, ender pearls, enchanted ender pearls, telekinesis 1 books, and end stone geodes (and other things probably), the latter being a reforge stone which we'll cover in the dungeons section, and also, these endermen I mentioned earlier have a chance to drop pets, 9k endermen being able to drop rare-legendary endermen pets, now Zealots, these guys are helpless mobs that are stabbed by fast children wearing dead dragons' skinsuits or other skinsuit wearing humans shooting ice spikes or exploding arrows or dangerous balloons, plus, Zealots have a 1/420 chance to spawn a Special Zealot, which has a 100% chance to drop a Summoning Eye, which can be used to spawn in Dragons (or sold to the Bazaar for around 600 thousand coins), now Dragons are bosses that spawn in the end, given 8 summoning eyes placed in the end portal frames, a random dragon can spawn (16% chance to spawn an Old, Protector, Wise, Unstable, Young, or Strong and a 4% chance to spawn a Superior), and once killed, depending on what placement you were for damaging the dragon and depending on how many eyes you placed, you can obtain fragments, dragon armor pieces, or things like the Phoenix pet or the Ender Dragon pet, and during the fight, dragons can either stand still and get killed by humans, rush toward nearest people, strike everyone with lightning, or shoot fireballs at children, also end crystals can spawn which heal the dragon for like 0.3 seconds until people shoot them with homing arrows and get crystal fragments, used to craft catalysts (triples minion outputs, they're one of the fuels that can be used in minions), and besides the dragon fight, there's also a different fight that can take place, a relatively new miniboss called the Endstone Protector, an iron golem that has 5 stages (fun fact, I actually told forums and the wiki about these 5 stages before anyone else did, so that's pretty nifty I would say, and yes, this was during the time when all staff said was something like \"there's a new miniboss in the end\" and no other information, so me spending 20 minutes figuring out how this miniboss works was pretty cool), anyway, yeah so the miniboss has 5 stages, each requiring a certain number of zealots to be killed, until finally it spawns, and it has a chance to drop End Stone, Enchanted End Stone, Endstone Flower thingies (endstone rose I think), and the two massively rare drops, Tier Boost Core (used to craft Tier Boost which can upgrade a pet to the above rarity), or the Golem Pet (epic or legendary), and you can also gain a larger chance to obtain these RNG drops if you killed zealots, the cap being at 100 zealots contributed (it's a very small increase in the chance of getting the drops), and so that was the end, now let's go over the forest quickly, so once you go to the Park from the Hub forest place, you can find multiple layers of floating islands, Birch, Spruce, Dark Oak, Acacia, and Jungle, where you can collect all these types of wood, items like the Jungle Axe and Tree Capitator can chop down multiple logs at a time, oh and so in the Park, there are many NPCs or quest thingies, in the Birch section, there's Charlie who wants stacks of each type of wood then just continues to say something like \"I forgot what I was going to say\", and there's also a woman named Vanessa who lets you buy rain for money since Hypixel understands the true purpose of cloud seeding (for more info on cloud seeding, go here), then there's a pond area where people fish, so then in the Spruce section, there's a floating island/house, home of the Melon Viking (his name is like Melancholic Viking, but I never knew how to spell that so I call him Melon Man, otherwise I call him Depressed Viking), and this dude has a quest for you where he's like \"help me remember the sea\" so you destroy his only source of warm air with a magical bucket of water, then slap a fish into his furnace, then twerk sneak in front of him around 20 times then he makes questionable noises and behavior then he becomes a Joyous Viking, allowing you to access his shop, where you can buy some book thing, a paper scroll, an iron axe, a player head disguised as a drug, and maybe some other things that I'm forgetting, anyhow that iron axe is called the Raider's Axe, a sword/axe that gives +15 coins per every mob killed (with exceptions), and it's comparable to an Aspect of the End, now then, let's go on over to the Dark Thicket AKA Dark Oak Wood forest place, where you can find yourself a campfire cult owned by some dude (named Ryan I think, I don't remember), and he wants you to burn yourself (or at least your legs) for extended periods of time, then give him extremely compact pieces of wood, then you get a custom player head that heals you while burning, which will never be useful since when are you going to be burning for a long time, exactly, never, so that's only good for its reforge boosts, which I'll go over in a bit (I think I went over it already but not in depth so, yeah), then the acacia forest place where you can meet an old dude who sells a tactician's sword and a wood singularity or whatever, then there's a mine place where you can mine gold ores for shiny rocks, used for a quest that I'm going to talk about in 4-786 seconds, depending on how fast you read, so once you climb up another floor, there's the Jungle Island, where there's an NPC called Juliette which I'm not a big fan of given that they copied that one literature guy, anyhow, it's a classic love story where the player needs to pay them over 10 million coins worth of items, including a very compact and hot bucket of lava, a flower slave that I mentioned twice earlier, a blade filled with hundreds of thousands of emeralds, and you have to wear one of those overpriced tuxedos I talked about a few lines back, then once you fuel Romero and Juliette's love completely, then you get a rock as an award, granting you a small chance to gain double damage, which I'm going to be honest here, given that it's a 1/100 chance, it's pretty cool when you deal double damage, except this one time I had seemingly gotten double damage like 5 times in a row, then I realized that it wasn't my luck being good, it was instead my brain being dumb and not realizing I had hearts rune on my weapon, anyhow, that's it for the forest thing, also fun fact, you can see the end island from where Juliette is, so that's pretty cool, also yeah, that's it for the forest, now there's one more chain of islands, the farming islands, so once you go through the portal from hub going to the Barn, you'll end up on an island filled with Pigs, Cows, Chickens, Carrots, Wheat, Potatoes, Melons, and Pumpkins, then you can go to the next island called the Mushroom Desert, where there's now Sheep, Sugarcane, Cactus, and (of course) Red/Brown Mushrooms, and then there's this unfinished portal thing made of sandstone, no one knows what it is, staff probably forgot about it too (lmao this is a joke), so yeah, then we are done with the islands, now let's talk about a different hub called the Dungeon Hub, but before we talk about dungeons, I'm going to talk about a few things I missed, so firstly, skyblock has a unique method of creating enchanted versions of items, for most minion related resources, you can \"enchant\" the items, basically combining 160 of them in a crafting table to get one enchanted corresponding item, and there are exceptions, sometimes it's not 160 and instead it's more or less, so keep that in mind, also SLAYERS, a mindless grind of 3 different mobs, zombies, spiders, and wolves, where you start the quest using coins, you kill a certain amount of the corresponding mob type, then you spawn in the boss, and then you kill the boss, then you repeat this around 15,000 times, then you get +2 health regeneration, so yeah, I think that that's all I really need to talk about, I'm going to safely assume, OH WAIT RIGHT I FORGOT fishing, so basically fishing is custom in skyblock, it's been\u2013uh\u2013adapted to resemble real life fishing, meaning you can pull out massive iron golems, guardians being ridden by bow spamming emperors, literal yetis, snowball spamming snowmen, frozen default minecraft characters, silverfish, sharks, chicken jockeys, other guardians by themselves, small self reproducing hydras, some green guys who steal presents from orphans, and a ton of other weird water creatures, all from a 1x1x1 water source, see, this makes perfect sense, so yeah, there's a ton of fishing stuff in the game, that was literally my point, next runic stuff I think I should mention, so you may see some mobs with purple names saying \"Runic\" in front of their normal tag and health bars, this means that once you kill them, you can get runes, which as a general rule, runes are completely useless, only keep the legendary ones, blood runes, and slayer runes since those three are the only runes that people care about, so ye, also a few things I want to specify, there's also some healing balls called orbs, healing sticks called wands, healing weapons called ornate zombie swords or normal zombie swords, a diamond sword obtained from the deaths of an average of 3368 zealots being murdered, then the dragon that is spawned also being murdered, uhmmm, there's also a few other things but I don't feel like talking about those, this was honestly just added to see if there's actually a limit to the number of characters you can have in a skyblock post, turns out that there doesn't seem to be any, therefore time to go over DUNGEONS except wait, PLUMBER JOE, sells underpriced sponges that clean up your water sources, okay now DUNGEONS, so dungeons are a decently new addition to the game, you basically get to survive and explore through complex labyrinths, filled with unique mobs (including zombie guys, skeleton guys, zombies that throw bones, ninja guys that shoot wither skulls, occasionally a strange hedgehog that has millions of health and can one shot basically everything, a few minibosses including more furries wearing dragon skinsuits, etc) then a magical boss fight at the end of every floor, preceded by a miniboss fight involving a floating eye, then once you finish the floor, depending on how well you did, you get prizes, in order from least expensive to most expensive, you can get a wooden chest (free), golden chest, diamond chest, emerald chest, obsidian chest, or bedrock chest, and you can get rare items including shadow assassin armor, adaptive armor, and more, so yeah that was dungeons, also I think I should talk about a few other things, like baits (can enhance your fishing), talismans (can give specific buffs and can be reforged to give other stat buffs), and oh right I forgot to mention the dungeon hub, so the dungeon hub is where you get to go do dungeons from, there's also a whole racing system built by the amazing build team (thank you guys for that), and there's also a blacksmith NPC who lets you use many things, starting with essence crafting, where you can upgrade specific equipment in order to get stars on them, maximum of 5 stars, which basically just improves their performance in dungeons, additionally, there's a way to sell dungeons stuff for essence, and of course, there's reforging, where you basically put in an item (or your entire talisman/accessory bag), and reforge them to get certain buffs and a prefix on the items, also, there's advanced reforging, where you use a reforge stone and some coins to get a different exclusive reforge, then you can also buy some dungeons buffs using essence, okay I think that that covers it all, oh my gosh that took me like eight hours not even kidding (actually, more like three hours), still this took me a long time, so I would appreciate it if you guys liked this thread or bumped it or something, ughhh okay anyway, one last thing I should mention, that is glitched items, so throughout skyblock, there have been many bugs causing glitched items to come into existence, these include null, banners, lucky blocks, placable backpacks, end portal frames, unnamed runes, horse armors, name tags, and more, if you want to check out some of these, be sure to visit an official island with these on display, TimeDeo has quite a few of these, SuperRedHulk1 used to have a TON of these (before he got wiped), and I'm fairly certain that the helper Centranos is currently working on his museum (Dark Treasury), so be sure to check those out, also I think this is a good time to plug my discord and my guild (jk jk, unless you actually care, in which case, check my signature), so without any more further ado, thank you for reading, and if you somehow read this entire thing, then go drink some water, take a walk, what are you doing with your life (don't ask that to me though, I won't be able to answer), so yeah, also if I forgot something, then I will kindly ask you to be quiet do you know how much pain I went through so yeah, hope you guys enjoyed and have a nice day."

This is by no mean representing any one/group other than myself. Don't go after others with full on toxic internet raging kid mode on. This is a gamemode on a server on a kod's favorite block game afterall.\n\nUpdate 0.9 - The Community Center Update\nThe update dropped almost 2 months ago, it offered a new building in the hub complete with new NPCs and features. Community projects, and 2 new currencies - Bits and Gems.\nBits are earned via playing the game while having a booster cookie active. However, the booster cookies can only be purchased via gem or over a million coins in the bazaar. (the first one is always free).\nHere's the controversial part - Gems. Gems can only be earned via real life currency or fishing for hundreds of hours. It is the first official currency in skyblock to be able to be purchased with real life money. This one is a red flag for a lot of players in the community.\nWhy?\nPlayers have many different arguments as of why gem is a bad addition. I've chosen the most common/interesting ones:\nGems are an easy way to earn millions of coins with just a few bucks. You can skip hours of grinding with money, it's just unfair to free to play (F2P) players who grinded for hours to get what pay to win (P2W) players can get in a few minutes.\nIt's a violation of Mojang's EULA of no pay to win in multiplayer servers. (This actually doesn't violate EULA due to skyblock being a PVE game) \nThis new addition is going to set Hypixel toward more microtransactions and ingame purchases in the future and will have a negative long-term impact on the server.\n\nThere are counter-arguments as well:\nPurchasing gem for millions of coins doesn't make you good. Sure you might have the best gears, but you'll have low skill levels. You still have to grind for all the skills, the essential part of skyblock is still there.\nGem is very effective at stopping black marketing by providing an official way to exchange real life money into skyblock wealth.\nGems provide extra revenue for Hypixel to hire more developers and staff to improve the server and push out skyblock updates at a faster pace, it'll have a positive impact in the long run.\n\nHere comes my opinion. If you can't take different opinions than yours, then stop reading right now.\nI personally think that this update does more positive than negative. Sure it does make F2P players feel unfair, but it stops many problems that had been plaging skyblock for so long like blackmarketing. It also helped to bring more developers to skyblock, which was much needed. Before gems, skyblock only had 2 developers and updates were coming out at a snail's pace. Now with more developers, updates and QOL changes are rolling out much quicker to keep skyblock alive and growing. This gem update is just like the pit club in The Pit gamemode. Sure it does offer some advantages, but ultimately nobody really cared that much.\n\nWhat are your opinions? Put your constructive opinions/criticism in the replies. I'll be reading them all."

(\"Heads? Psh. I'm a tailsman myself.\")\n\nSkyblock should 100% lean in to this. Create a \"red reforge\" that turns rogue swords red and changes their name to \"rouge sword.\" (It should be in the Bank I collection: once you have collected 100 Bank I books from dungeon chests, you get a free red reforge.)\n\nPlease make this happen.\n\nI hope you all have a great day!"

It involved placing saplings with a builder's wand and then farming the trees that grew.\nToday, many of us awoke to see this message.\n\n\n\n\nThis was an unfair removal.\nThe builders wand did everything it was supposed to. Placing saplings was an intended feature.\n\nUnlike Ghast Farming, which was macroable, this was not. It took effort to build the farm, plant, and destroy the trees. I see no reason for the admins to remove this as it is has pretty much the exactly the same effect as a Replenish enchanted hoe had on farming.\n\nBring back Sapling Placement.\n\nEdit: I'm going to try to spread this as much as possible so there's a bigger possibility admins can see.\nMy message to admins: Please consider reversing your shadow deletion of sapling placement, it harms more people than you think, it invalidates hours of effort. A nerf would be better received.\n\nEdit two: I'm going to add suggestions for nerfs here so that maybe admins will reconsider adding it!\n@Sir_Bacon_2020 suggested to keep it in the game, but nerf the exp gain.\n@Kashapo suggested to not nerf the exp, but instead make the saplings grow slower.\n@Athyestic suggested that the trees grow according to the Terraria rules, such as: \" There must be at least three open tiles between two Saplings or only one will grow into a tree. \" so that there are not as many trees."

It has the best ability for a sword and also deals a devastating blow when it's a critical hit. Put hot potato books to maximize this weapons' damage to make it even better.\n\nPickaxe : \nOverall : Diamond Pickaxe\n\nThis is the best pickaxe to get your hands on... To get the max. potential out of it, enchant it with Efficiency V, Fortune and Experience III, Smelting Touch and Telekinesis. Great for getting XP, mostly when equipping lapis armor\n\nAs a drill : Stonk\n\nYou might be thinking : Hey, this pickaxe \"stonks\" (ba dum tss)... Maybe, but it's an insane tool to get several stacks of cobblestone when equipping the miner's outfit. Seriously, this might be the Super Compactor 3000 farmer's best friend.\n\nAxe : Jungle\n\nWhen enchanted with Efficiency V and Telekinesis, this fills Minion Storage farming satisfying... Idk why, but the fact that you mine several wood logs at once is so great\n\nShovel : Flint Shovel (Trihard made me remember it's better than golden shovel)\n\nThe flint shovel has everything the golden shovel has, and always gets flint from gravel... No more putting gravel and have luck to get flint (If only I could get one in UHCs)\n\nHoe : Rookie Hoe\n\nThis is a real deal : Get it from the merchant and put Harvesting V on it... Unlike any other hoe (your neighbourhood hoe included xd), it has a 50% chance to get double crops, and it's great for sugar cane farms, since you can get up to 8 crops (AFAIK) with it\n\nSince this thread was necro'd, I'll update this, here's the changes :\nBest Sword : 50mil Midas\nBest Axe : Treecapitator"

    "body": "I really love this farming update. But I was also disappointed with how bad the axes were compared to the hoes. The hoes grant 100-200% extra drop chance for their respective crop and go up to mythic if you recomb them. Meanwhile the pumpkin/melon dicer only give 5% extra xp, have epic rarity and the ability to get random extra drops that dont even count towards your collection. So there is no reason to get both axes unless you want to farm both for xp. And dont even get me started on the Coco Chopper, that thing is literally useless. Just get replenish on pumpkin/melon dicer.\n\nSo here are my suggestions to make them better. First of all, the extra drops should count towards your collection.\nSecondly I think there should be more really rare drops, here are a few examples of what im thinking off:\n\nPumpkin Dicer rare drops: \n- Farming Stone (reforge stone): Used to apply the sweaty reforge to hoes/axes. Gain +2/4/6/8/10/12% farming xp\n- Carrot treat (pet item): Used to upgrade rabbit pet to mythic rarity. Buffs the minion speed and farming xp perk to 40%\n\nMelon Dicer rare drops: \n- Fertilizer Stone (reforge stone): Used to apply the fertile reforge to hoes/axes. Increases Chance for double drops by 6/10/15/21/27/35%\n- Mammoth tusk (pet item): Used to upgrade elephant pet to mythic rarity. Buffs the extra drop chance perk to 60% and adds extra perk that doubles the reforge of the tool you are currently using\n\nCoco Chopper rare drops: \n- Dicey Stone (reforge stone): Used to apply the dicey reforge to tools, gain +2/4/6/8/10/12 magic find and increases the drop chance for rare items of the 3 jacob axes by 10%"

So each farming level would give you +1 speed giving a total of +60 speed when you are farming 60. This would be a rare talisman or maybe uncommon. Let me know what you think about this idea. And/ or what I could change about this idea.\n\nEdit #1: Ok so I feel like the stats that this talisman should be changed to .25-.5 speed per farming lvl I'm to too sure yet. Also maybe it would give a 1% chance for double drops per farming lvl. I'm trying to not make this op so that way I have a chance at getting this actually added into the game.\n\nEdit #2: So I was thinking about this idea and thought that maybe this talisman could be given to someone once they hit farming lvl 10. then kind of like dolphin pet and rock pet it could tier up at certain milestones. So at lvl 10 it would be a common talisman, at lvl 20 an uncommon, lvl 30 rare, lvl 40 epic, lvl 50 legendary, and at lvl 60 it would become a mythic. I know making it a base rarity of mythic has never been added but farming 60 is double the xp as farming 50 so it would be worth it to give the person it as mythic because of the grind it would take for farming 60.\nEdit #3:"

Each of the minions have 5 million health, but not all minions have the same attitude (One healer, one mage, one berserker, one archer, and one tank).\n\nIt is suggested to kill the healer first as it can heal Goldor himself and other minions. ALL teammates should participate in this phase.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2\n\n\n\n[GOLDOR] What??? My minions are unstoppable!!\n[GOLDOR] Well guess what, you all have to attack me!!!\n\nPlayers actually kill Goldor himself. He has 20 million health, so it is suggested that your damage is high (but not too high that you won't have enough defense). \n\nIt is suggested that ALL teammates participate in this phase. \n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 3\n\n\n\n[GOLDOR] Congrats on killing me.\n[GOLDOR] I hate Livid so much, so I will honor Thorn with the power of my skeletons.\n[THORN] Thank you SO much Goldor.\n[GOLDOR] You're welcome Thorn.\n[GOLDOR] Guess what guys. You have to make me laugh!\n\nIn this phase, you have to kill Golden Wither Skeletons which have 10 million health. Goldor's laugh meter starts at nothing, and when 50 Golden Wither Skeletons are killed the laugh meter goes to full.\n\nA hyper cleaver is going to be useful in this stage since the Skeletons are close to each other.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 4\n\n\n\n[GOLDOR] You really made me laugh XD!!!\n[GOLDOR] You really thought this would be the last.\n[GOLDOR] I am reviving my minions, AND myself to make me the strongest.\n[SCARF] Hey!!! Why did you copy me?\n[GOLDOR] Hey!!! Be quiet.\n\nThis phase is basically a combo of phases 1 and 2. The minions have 50% more health than last time and will do 25% more damage. Goldor has 30 million health this time. It's VERY important that ALL teammates participate in this phase.\n\nOnce again, it is suggested to kill the healer before any other otherwise minions + Goldor will heal.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: End fail\n\n\n\n[GOLDOR] Who knew how keen I still am.\n[GOLDOR] So long adventurers.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: End\n\n\n\n[GOLDOR] I'm very exhausted right now.\n[GOLDOR] I can't believe Maxor wasn't strong enough.\n[MAXOR] What do you mean???\n[GOLDOR] I can't explain right now.\n[GOLDOR] This won't be the last of the catacombs adventurers.\n[NECRON] Congrats!\n\n\n\nIf you think this is amazing, be sure to leave a bump."

Like the free chest could give you 60k in return, WITH A B.\nThe comprise:\nPeople want to add essence to bazaar, so people won't get scammed.\nI say, that you should add an essence option in the trade menu, and then you can pay the according amount money per essence. This does not crash the economy, and people won't get scammed!\nTL;DR:\nAdd an essence option in the trade menu.\nPut your ideas down in chat!"

It would basically build with the items you put in the wand a cane farm or a potato farm. Or whatever type of farm the schematic is meant for. You would still have to place the crops but this would build the dirt and lighting layout for the farm. This could cost like 1 gold medal to buy and there would be a specific schematic for each type of crop for a buildable farm."

But Rev is the best if you are grinding for combat xp. Svens generally is to just get to level 6 for the mana flux which can be used to do revs/taras, or to get to level 7 and get overflux and make big bucks.\n\nEdit: Doing Tarantulas is my own personal preference. I don't recommend it for everyone because everyone has their own opinion and agenda for doing slayers. As I said above, each kind of slayers has its unique good part of it, I just find tarantulas better\n\nHere is all I know!\n\n\nPlease tell me if I made a Mistake on anything!\nPlease also tell me if I miss anything!

    "title": "[Idea] Combining Pets",
    "body": "One of my favorite thing about skyblock has to be the pets. Not only do you get a companion, but you also become stronger in whatever you decide. And as I was thinking of how hypixel could bring more pets to everyone, I thought to myself, \"Why not just combine them?\"\n\nLet's say you combine the Rabbit pet and the Elephant pet to get: 'Rabbiphant'.\n\nAs requirements to combine, both need to be legendary and maxed level. Lets also use a similar approach of upgrading pets with Kat. She will take both pets and take [x] days (just an example) to combine both of them... The 2 pets will become a brand new mythic level 1 pet (leaving it at lvl 100 might be fine). Of course, this would be a very late-game thing to do. I think that combining pets should also cost you money (the same way you have to do with upgrading them using Kat).\n\nOne of the abilities for this new pet would be, \"Happy Stomp\". Happy Stomp, gives you [x] defense for every [x] speed you have and will also make the jump potion give you [x] speed. (I'm using [x] because maybe they can buff abilities or leave the as they are now.)\n\nFor another example, let's combine Trunk Efficiency and Farming Exp Boost to create \"Farming Trunk\". This ability will let you gain more exp from farming while also increasing your chance of double crops.\n\nTo finish this, I know that this is a rough idea, but I think it would be a great way for Skyblock to bring more pets into the game while using already existing ones.\n\nTell me what you think of this idea and if you would like it or not. Again, this is only a rough idea so I'm sure there are a lot of places where it could be improved upon."

    "title": "Some late-night ideas I had while farming for fishing",
    "body": "New fishing island introduction\n\n\nSpoiler: Vast Seas\n\n\n\nThis new island would have 5 different sections of fishing spot.\n1. Cape of Shipwrecks\n2. Coral Reefs\n3. Volanic Islands\n4. Kraken's Lair\n5. Underwater Battleground\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Cape of Shipwrecks\n\n\n\nThis would be the more beginner part of the islands. It requires a fishing level of 15 to enter. This would be the first treasure fishing spot, where instead of sea creatures you would fish for treasure. Spoiler for loot/mechanics below the 5 sections descriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Coral Reefs\n\n\n\nThis spot would have docile and new creatures to fish up. A fishing level of 20 is required to enter. There would be a once every 6 hours event called the \"Rave Event\" which new and extremely rare creatures drop valuables Spoiler for loot/mechanics below the 5 sections descriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Volanic Islands\n\n\n\nThis place would be more of a community golem/zealot grind. A fishing level of 25 is required to enter. Here you would fish up various dangerous mobs that you need special armor to beat (sup, strong, shadow assassin would be useless against these minibosses.) Once the players on the island have killed enough of these creatures, a very strong Lochness Monster spawns. It would be immune to anything but fishing rods, and it would do major single-target damage. Once killed, the loot it gives will distribute based on how much creatures you fished up to contribute. The island would need to kill 200 of these creatures, and you are ineligible for the rewards if you fished up less then 10. The more you fished up, the more loot you would get, up to two Bait Buckets. These would be like the summoning eyes for dragons, except it wakes up the kraken... (Also damage matters)\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Kraken's Lair\n\n\n\nUnlike dragon fights, there will only by one \"type\" of kraken: Woken. A fishing level of 25 is required to enter.The Woken Kraken has 100M hp and is immune to everything but fishing weapons. It will kinda sit there and take damage and attack players using three damages for its first 50% hp: Tsunami, Crush, and a true damage attack, drown. Tsunami will deal around ~30,000 damage plus another 10,000 per 1k hp the player has (so, a player with 3k hp gets hit for 60k damage) (ofc, defense helps) so you want a decently high ehp armor for killing the kraken. Crush deals ~40k but doesnt scale with health. Drown will deal 100% of the player's strength as true damage. The kraken is spawned with 16 bait buckets and weight is calculated like dragons. The next 25% of their health, they will use high single target damage that will 1shot anyone without special fishing armor in the earlier sections. A couple ideas were torpedo, waterspout, and naval mine (naval mine would be just an invis armor stand with a head that looks like a naval mine or something, a waterspout I dont really know how that would work but it would kinda suck players into it and deal damage, torpedo would just be another invis armor stand thing.) The last 25% of his health he summons strong and tiny mobs called \"Kraken's spawn\" it would kinda be like sven's pups, they dont do much damage on their own but together they drain people extremely fast. Loot from kraken below the 5 sections description\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Underwater Battleground\n\n\n\nThis place would have more then 20 new very hostile and end-game sea creatures. A fishing level of 30 is required to enter this place. Description of mobs and loot below the 5 sections descriptions\n\n\nBefore we get to the loot/new mobs, please add something else to the fishing skill. More sea creature chance, more something.\n\n\nSpoiler: Cape of Shipwrecks - Loot\n\n\n\nThings you can fish up for treasure fishing: Bits (1-300 for a common drop, 301-1k for an uncommon, 1,o01-3k for an extremely rare, and 3,001 to 8k for omega rare kinda odds.) This would mean, finally, ironman profiles can obtain bits to spend. A pet item that gives 20% faster catches (so if you already have 100% scc and dont need souvenir, you can use this.) More coins, preferably 100k-200k as a more common drop, 200,001-500k uncommon, 500,001 to 1m uber rare etc just some coins to throw in, Rod Enhancers you can catch these maybe once every 2,000 or so catches. They will give an amount of sea creature chance 1-5, and fishing speed 1-20% faster. You can only apply one rod enhancer per rod, you can switch enhancers but they will be deleted kinda like how pet items work. You can catch a specific rare sea creature's bait bucket (for upcoming islands) MORE IDEAS TO BE ADDED. I am waiting for more feedback before adding ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Coral Reefs\n\n\n\nNew Sea Creatures:\nHardened Clam (Level 20 fishing requirement): Drops Raw fish, Ink sacs, and rarely pearls. Pearls can craft a pearl necklace, which is an uncommon talisman that grants +1% sea creature chance.\nFiesty Crab (Level 21 fishing requirement) Drops: Lily pad, Raw salmon, pufferfish, enchanted bones, and rare crab shells that crab craft armor. This armor is like a mid-game angler set. Its full set bonus gives 20% faster fishing time.\nPokey Urchin (Level 22 requirement)Drops: Prismarine crystals/shards, pufferfish, and an extremely rare urchin gauntlet. It would not count as a talisman, but the more sea creatures you kill with the item in your inventory, the more stats you get TBA \nBlue-ringed octopus (Level 23 requirement) Drops: Ink sack, Raw fish, Rare Ink Singularity that is used to upgrade the ink wand to do more damage.\nDeadly Jellyfish (IDEAS TBA, WAITING FOR FEEDBACK)\nSea Turtle (IDEAS TBA, WAITING FOR FEEDBACK)\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Volanic Islands\n\n\n\nIDEAS TBA WAITING FOR FEEDBACK\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Kraken's Lair\n\n\n\nIDEAS TBA WAITING FOR FEEDBACK\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Underwater Battleground\n\n\n\nIDEAS TBA WAITING FOR FEEDBACK\n\n\nSo yeah, I'm waiting for feedback for this to update it. If you like it, please give it a thumbs up, and any ideas if you reply ill credit you if I decide to add it. Thanks for reading!\u200b"

The portal isn't there.

I try to place a block in a certain position which does not work, but I move three blocks over (and up, if it makes any difference) and the block places just fine.

    "body": "Hi! Today I'm bringing your attention to an idea I had that could make life in Skyblock just a tad bit easier!\n\nDo you find yourself swapping pets/armor often? Does it bother you having to click on a bunch of different menus in order to swap from your dolphin pet to your squid pet? If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with disliking these things then I have the QOL invention for you!\n\nIntroducing the Portable Kennel and the Portable Wardrobe!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I know what you're thinking... it's a Gnome.\n\nNo, that is a placeholder because I am not good at making things and I don't know how to make custom items so I worked with the resources I had in game. Imagine it looks like a tiny bookshelf or a tiny doghouse.\n\nNow to explain how this works!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting with the Portable Wardrobe. As demonstrated by the Gnome, it will be an item that sit's in your inventory. From your base wardrobe menu you can select two sets of armor to link with the portable wardrobe by right clicking on the pink dye. This will cause the dye to highlight purple, signifying that you have successfully linked that armor with the Port Wardrobe. Now the way the wardrobe works is simple. Similar to a Builder Wand, if you right click with the Port Wardrobe in your hand, it will allow you to swap between your two selected armor pieces instantly, removing the need to navigate through several menus. You can also left click the Port Wardrobe which will simply open up the regular wardrobe menu where you can freely switch to whatever armor you want on, or change your selected portable armor sets.\n\nNow moving onto the Portable Kennel!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Port Kennel works very similar to the Port Wardrobe, only it can be used to quickly swap between two pets. Right clicking the Port Kennel allows you to swap between your two selected pets with ease. This is perfect for fishermen who want to fish up as many sea creatures as they can, while also earning the most xp they can from said sea creatures. Left clicking of course brings you to your pet menu. In order to select which pets you want to swap between, the pets menu will have an icon for the Port Kennel as signified by my lil Gnome. Clicking the icon will bring you to a menu like the one in the second picture. From here you can click the different slots and choose which two pets you want to link to your Port Kennel.\n\nAnd that is all for my QOL post! Feel free to leave other suggestions and comments!\n\nAlso sorry again for the poor quality, I'm not very good with this stuff!"

He tried every single type of kits, and classes. He worked as a medic, a soldier, a doctor and many other types.\nIt was Goldor, the true Soldier.\nHowever, no one accepted his heart. They were jealous of his powers. His skills were so powerful that no one can use their word to describe its strength. Not only he could read their thoughts, but he could also enhance it and make himself a better person.\nThis is his story...\nOnce upon a time, Goldor was a young kid waiting for his father to return home. He was playing with his toy car, and passers-by walked past him and ignored him as if he was invisible. Goldor was immune to that because it happens to anyone else. The heart of the town is blue, meaning it is very dark and cold-hearted.\nHis father returned. There was a paper on his hand.\n\"Dad, what's that?\"\n\"You don't need to know about it, my son.\"\nGoldor's father looks rather sad. He looked away from him. Goldor knew something was wrong. A few hours later, a group of soldiers came into the town.\n\"Independence, or death!\" The leader said.\n\"If we get no revolution, we would rather die. This town will be the one that sacrifices themselves, for them to succeed at surviving!\"\n\"Fathers, it is indescribable, but you will be the one that is the heroes. You are the only one that can protect us from the death war, which is coming soon.\"\nGoldor cried when he heard that.\nHis father, old and weak. Even after the announcement, Goldor watched his father struggling with basic skills.\n\"Father, I will be the one that protects you,\" Goldor said.\n\"Son, you can't. You are only 6 years old. You are too young! Don't worry, son. Your father would not die.\" Father replied.\n\"No! I must protect you! You are old and weak! You will die if you are like this... please!\" Goldor cried.\nHis father still refused. He hugged him and walked away.\n\nThat day after that night will be the day where fathers go to the army's dwelling. Goldor stole his father's armor. Thankfully, he was as tall as an adult for some reason. He ran away during that night...\n\nA few years passed. The army fought with a lot of wars. It was as if a wind came, and blew the soldiers to death one... by one. Goldor, however, was still alive, safe and sound. His skills were indescribable.\nFinally, the war had truly ended. Goldor, was the only one who survived. He left the troop. However, when he went home...\n\n...his father was there, dead!\n\nGoldor took a knife and killed himself. Later, he woke up at another place. This time round, it was cold. A face was right in front of him.\n\n\"Who... are you?\" Goldor said.\n\"Necron, the world shall know... your father was dead during the war. However, I shall give you a new home. this time round, you are going to be my right hand man...\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A true soldier never dies.\" -- Goldor"

    "body": "If we all look at major revolutions and uprisings in history, we can all see that it started with class division and class struggle. While the rich and the nobles maintained higher social privileges, and economic power, the poor commoners and peasants were breaking their backs while having to pay impossible amount of tax. This led to the French and the Russian revolution which we know, has shaped our course of history in the different ways. While Skyblock is just a game, it meets all of the conditions that France and Russia had before their revolution. There is the nobles(ranked players) and the bourgeoisie ( rich people), and there is the nons ( the peasants). It is no doubt that ranked players have much higher social and economic status than the nons. Ranked players will get richer as the game progresses while nons who cannot make millions of coins due to high competition will inevitably get poorer. But it is understandable why hypixel is giving ranked players more privileges as they need money. But trust me, if there is no reformation of social status in skyblock, the nons, who are apparently the majority of skyblock and hypixel players, will revolt. As i am a non myself, we do not want all nons to be as equal to ranked players. But we do not want ranked players to be given a game affecting privileges such as quick crafting. If this is not fixed, trust me, history will repeat it self.\n\n-ps, i don't know why i wrote this thing so seriously, but i just like writing articles."
