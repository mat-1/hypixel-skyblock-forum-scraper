It is full of despair, anger, sadness, addiction, and hopelessness. Every day, people waste hours upon hours of their lives sweating in Skyblock, desperately seeking anything that can get them further ahead in the game, even if it means hurting other people in the process.\n\nI think something seriously needs to happen to Skyblock in terms of allowed playtime in it. There\u2019s no way that it can keep going on the way it is without there being serious consequences to kids in real life. This addiction that most have to grinding is affecting their lives in really bad ways. Lots of them purposefully miss online classes just to partake in it. Increasing anger over stolen items, slowly developing depression from the absolute nothing that it brings to someone\u2019s emotional and mental health state, etc.\n\nMy proposal is to introduce a time limit per day for players when it comes to Skyblock. This is the only way that I can see any of this being fixed. Make no mistake, I\u2019m extremely aware of how unpopular this is gonna be to a lot of people. I realize that I will likely be called very bad names by several people for me even thinking to suggest this, but I think it\u2019s crucial that it be brought up.\n\n2 different 3 hour spans a day, Skyblock would be open to all players, 3 hours in the morning, and 3 hours in the evening/night time, to hopefully cater to multiple time zones across the world, and to also allow most kids to be able to play without interrupting their online classes, or in person classes.\n\nI think by introducing this limited playtime, it would turn into sort of a Grinch Simulator effect, where people can actually have fun in Skyblock, knowing that they only get a limited amount in it per day. I think the hostile atmosphere will be dramatically less, as you won\u2019t get anyone who\u2019s been in there the past 15 hours no sleep, and I think that it will shine the spotlight on more areas of Hypixel that most players probably might not be familiar with, like Turbo Cart Racers and Warlords, etc."}, {"title": "Healer berserker build", "body": "What armor should I use for a healer berserker hybrid.
