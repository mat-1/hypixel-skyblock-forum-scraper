    "title": "Idea: Limit the Daily Playtime in Skyblock",
    "body": "Skyblock is a land void of happiness. It is full of despair, anger, sadness, addiction, and hopelessness. Every day, people waste hours upon hours of their lives sweating in Skyblock, desperately seeking anything that can get them further ahead in the game, even if it means hurting other people in the process.\n\nI think something seriously needs to happen to Skyblock in terms of allowed playtime in it. There\u2019s no way that it can keep going on the way it is without there being serious consequences to kids in real life. This addiction that most have to grinding is affecting their lives in really bad ways. Lots of them purposefully miss online classes just to partake in it. Increasing anger over stolen items, slowly developing depression from the absolute nothing that it brings to someone\u2019s emotional and mental health state, etc.\n\nMy proposal is to introduce a time limit per day for players when it comes to Skyblock. This is the only way that I can see any of this being fixed. Make no mistake, I\u2019m extremely aware of how unpopular this is gonna be to a lot of people. I realize that I will likely be called very bad names by several people for me even thinking to suggest this, but I think it\u2019s crucial that it be brought up.\n\n2 different 3 hour spans a day, Skyblock would be open to all players, 3 hours in the morning, and 3 hours in the evening/night time, to hopefully cater to multiple time zones across the world, and to also allow most kids to be able to play without interrupting their online classes, or in person classes.\n\nI think by introducing this limited playtime, it would turn into sort of a Grinch Simulator effect, where people can actually have fun in Skyblock, knowing that they only get a limited amount in it per day. I think the hostile atmosphere will be dramatically less, as you won\u2019t get anyone who\u2019s been in there the past 15 hours no sleep, and I think that it will shine the spotlight on more areas of Hypixel that most players probably might not be familiar with, like Turbo Cart Racers and Warlords, etc."

It makes it so that you can gain +50% stats from another selected sword. You can do this for any sword. For example, if a sword has 200 strength, and you reflect it onto the Speedy Sword, you gain +100 strength on the speedy sword until you switch the selected sword. It can be star-upgraded from metal essence, an essence that can be obtained in dungeons from Ooze (nice), the Woke Golem, in post-boss chests, or from salvaging metal-like weapons (not recommended)."

Placing saplings was an intended feature.\n\nUnlike Ghast Farming, which was macroable, this was not. It took effort to build the farm, plant, and destroy the trees. I see no reason for the admins to remove this as it is has pretty much the exactly the same effect as a Replenish enchanted hoe had on farming.\n\nBring back Sapling Placement.\n\nEdit: I'm going to try to spread this as much as possible so there's a bigger possibility admins can see.\nMy message to admins: Please consider reversing your shadow nerf on sapling placement, it harms more people than you think, it invalidates hours of effort. A nerf would be better received.\n\nEdit two: I'm going to add suggestions for nerfs here so that maybe admins will reconsider adding it!\n@Sir_Bacon_2020 suggested to keep it in the game, but nerf the exp gain.\n@Kashapo suggested to not nerf the exp, but instead make the saplings grow slower.\n@Athyestic suggested that the trees grow according to the Terraria rules, such as: \" There must be at least three open tiles between two Saplings or only one will grow into a tree. \" so that there are not as many trees."

Cuz people are always trying to max stuff, hence the whole \"grind for hours for +2 strength\" sorta thing.\nPlayers that join right now are going to miss out on stuff like the discounts at shops, which is a huge problem. \nI propose one of two options:\n1. Add a \"magical time table\" where you can contribute to past projects for a slightly increased cost (say like x1.2 price)\n2. After every building gets upgraded once, the 2nd upgrade to each building has the SAME bonuses as the first, and people who already did upgrades will already have their contributions. It just gives people who didnt contribute a chance to catch up. (This might be a problem where people who already contributed wouldn't help anymore, so maybe add a workaround)"

At the end of the day, it is extremely hard to prove someone irls, so please stop accusing people of it."

    "title": "[IDEA] Trading History, Deep Caverns revamp and more: 4000 words, 35+ positive reactions!",
    "body": "hi\n\n\nSpoiler: The Ancient Dragon (Quest): ~9800 symbols!\n\n\n\nMost of the Skyblock quests are pretty boring for me, and honestly, they can be way better. The point of this idea is to make major quests that are fun and balanced between mid-game and end-game players. I don't know about you, but i don't think you will have more fun oneshotting everyone in sight to finish the quest. Alright, i'm done with this. Now the idea.\n\nPart 1: Sub-Area \"Heart of the Mountain\"\nThe Heart of the Mountain is a parkour challenge accessible by going through a hidden entrance in the back of the Mountain. Upon entering it, all your stats will drop to the basics and items like Grappling Hook won't be usable. That's made so that you can't cheese it with Rabbit 6, Jump Boost 8 and Young Dragon Armor. The challenge consists of 3 parts: The caves, the underground and the core. When clearing a part, you will gain a fast travel option to where you are. That works pretty much like checkpoints. I tried my best to design the parts so that even people not used to parkour will be able to pass them, but parkour masters will go it way faster, which is fully deserved. Not like you can learn to parkour in a day.\n\nPart 1.1: The three parts\nThe three parts are very different in design, difficulty and other stuff. Here's the basics of how they look: the caves are made in mostly gray and black colors, with pretty easy parkour. The hardest jumps are a few neos, which, well, aren't even hard. The underground adds a bit of red and orange design to show you're getting closer to the core, and the parkour becomes significantly harder. It starts with a double neo, has a few neups on the way, not that bad but much harder than the caves. The core is the final challenge. Even harder than the underground, consists mostly of red and orange colors with lava flowing. There's still gray, but just a bit of it. The red and orange colors take up about 70% of the core. The parkour, too, gets harder. Although the core is by far the shortest one of the 3 parts, the jumps are really hard. Starting with a double neo, having a few neos in the way and ending with a neup after a few 4 block jumps, the core can take quite a lot of time. The area should be passed within 1hour by people average at parkour, 3 hours by people bad at it, and about 30 minutes by people really good at parkour.\n\nPart 1.2: The parkour rewards\nThe parkour isn't easy, so the rewards have to be pretty good. There are 4 things you get for completing the course, and there they are: The Mountain Core looks like a red firework core and is used in the crafting recipe for the Mountain Heart: The core in the middle, surrounded by 8 stacks of enchanted cobblestone. The Mountain Heart is an Epic accessory that grants 5 Strength, 5 Crit Chance, 10 Health and 5 Defense. The second thing is simple. 6 Fairy souls. If i'm not wrong, there are currently 209 available fairy souls in the game so these will give you 2 more possible stat boosts. Pretty solid. The third one is the main thing here, the Unstable Portal. It's a gateway to the major quest \"The Ancient Dragon\".\n\nPart 2: The Ancient Dragon quest - Story\nA long time ago, there was a clan on the territory which later becomes the place for the Village to be. Over time, it fell and only one person was still living there, Old Adventurer. Everyone else left the clan searching for better places to live. Recently, a powerful creature decided to live nearby the Old Adventurer: the Pure Dragon. Luckily, it didn't notice the old adventurer at first so he had time to hide. Living in a cave, he's safe from the dragon, but he can't really go anywhere now. There's only a little area where the dragon can't hear or see him, which became the farm he's using to provide himself with food. He managed to see how strong and merciless the dragon is, and decided to just wait in the cave until the dragon leaves the place forever. That's not happening anytime soon...\n\nPart 3: The Ancient Dragon quest - Action\nWhen you warp in through the portal, instead of warping it to the overworld (like the signs suggest) the portal warps you back in time. All your items are lost and the pure dragon is gone on a hunt. You can still go back by simply using the SB menu, and your items will be alright in the normal time. The old adventurer knows when the dragon usually comes back, and doesn't risk coming out. The dragon, obviously, only arrives once you find the place. Hints are thrown around the place showing where he is, so this shouldn't be a big problem. Once you find the Old Adventurer, you can talk to him and he will give you an old helmet, an old bow and an old sword and a map to protect yourself just in case if something goes terribly wrong. The entrance closes, so now you're stuck with him. When talking to him again, he will provide various hints that you have to find a secret passage through the wall that even he never knew about. That passage can provide a safe exit out of the village, but now the old adventurer doesn't want to leave so much. Instead, he's thinking about having revenge on the dragon since he has someone to help now. Now, the main action starts. You can collect Iron hidden around the place by going through the secret passage. There's a total of 18 Iron hidden around the map, not all of which is accessible instantly. It's used to upgrade your gear: The old helmet only has 50 HP and 50 DEF, but each stat goes up by 25 when its upgraded. Upgrades 1/2/3/ cost 1/2/3 iron respectively. The bow and sword work the same: 50 DMG and STR to start off, +25 to each stat when upgraded. the upgraded versions are called: Old, Recovered, Polished and Perfect.\nThe quest goal is to fight the Pure Dragon multiple times, each time he will go away. After fighting him for the first time by going to the top of the mountain when he's on a hunt (1:00 to 2:00 AM skyblock time) and waiting until he comes back, the map will start showing the new location of the dragon. Further fights are more simple, just come close to him and the fight starts. As he flies further, more areas and therefore more Iron is accessible. In a total of 4 fights, he goes from Home -> Forest -> Floating Islands (Jungles) -> The End. At each battle, the dragon has 10,000/20,000/30,000/100,000 HP respectively. More iron is unlocked too, with a total of 2 iron being available at the start and 3/6/9 iron being unlocked with each battle respectively. At the battle in The End, although the dragon has 100,000 HP, the Old Adventurer will instantly kill (supposedly finish) him once you've dealt 40,000 HP damage. That's a special cutscene, in which he jumps in from above and uses the Pure Chains to lock himself inside the egg in the middle of the Dragon's Nest, where the fight is happening too. As hunderds of years pass we're back in the current times, the Pure Dragon eventually dies and dissapears into the air, however out of the dust left by him, another dragon is born and starts growing... the only way to free him from the egg is by placing 12 Summoning Eyes into the altar below. Also, speaking of Pure Chains. That's an item found in a cave at the very top of the mountain, the area that unlocks when defeating the dragon for the second time. The item is required to make bridges from island to island, as there are no portals. The old adventurer gives a hint on where the Pure Chains are, saying \"I don't think we can follow the dragon to the Floating Islands... There was a storage in our clan before, but the dragon took it to where he lived before you came. There's probably nothing left, but maybe you can check it?\". When you climb, there's only gonna be the chain on top. Give it to the old adventurer, and he will say \"The chains are different from what i remember. Not sure if that's a good thing anyway.\" and take the chains. That's pretty much it.\n\nPart 4: Rewards\nI'm writing this a bit later than the eariler parts and i'm sorry if something doesn't match with what i said before.\nTo the rewards. The quest itself is really long and big, so the rewards are huge as well.\nThe first reward is Pure Scale and it's a drop from the final Pure Dragon bossfight. It's one of the two items that can be transfered from the past to the normal skyblock world. If your inventory is full as you get in the normal world with a Pure Scale, it will be in your stash. So, what does it do? You can combine it with a Summoning Eye in a crafting table to get an Awakened Eye. Then, you can place the A. Eye in one single middle frame of the altar. Once it's placed, the Pure Dragon will appear. It has 15M health and can use all of the attacks used by normal dragons. For the single person who placed the eye, it will always drop 2 or 3 Pure fragments to the person who placed it and 3-4 random fragments to people who simply damaged it. The chances of getting a specific type of a fragment are the same as getting a specific type of a dragon (4% for Superior and 16% for everything else). Out of the Pure fragments, the Pure Dragon armor can be made using the classic dragon armor recipe. The PD armor has the stats of Unstable with 100 more defense for each piece, HOWEVER its full set bonus grants you all of the dragon armor effects expect for the Superior and Holy effects, their bonuses are nerfed to 1.7% regen speed and 3% stat boosts. I'm honestly not sure about this one, it should probably be buffed and nerfed a lot of times.\nThe second reward, as if the PD armor wasn't enough, is an epic accessory called \"A Relic from the Past\". the Old Adventurer will give you the accessory after defeating the PD for the last time as a gift. It's also one of the two items that can be transfered to the normal world. The effect is pretty simple: All the reforges applied have their negative effects removed, and the positive effects are buffed by 1.5%.\n\nPart 5: Afterwords\nHonestly, i think this area can be used for more quests or bossfights. Not sure about that though.\nI've spent a few days working on this, and the only problems i currently see with this is the quest being so large it can't be added because of that.\nIf you have any ideas to improve this one, please tell them in the replies! Bumps are always appreciated, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Trading History (Menu option): ~3000 symbols!\n\n\n\nThis idea is basically what the name suggests. It's pretty simple, but i'm gonna try to explain this in details.\nThe trading history option is located in the top left corner of the menu and looks like a diamond.\n\nPart 1: Design\nThe sides are covered with black glass panels, as a lot of other menu parts in Skyblock. The history itself is shown in a lot of heads sorted by whatever you want it to be sorted by. The options are Newest first, oldest first and biggest first (amount of different items in trade). When you hover over a head, it shows what the trade was like. Example below:\n\n\nSpoiler: Trade details\n\n\n\nTrade with Player\n+100,000 coins\n-Leather Boots (Colored: #9300D3)\nTrade completed: September 11, 2001\nID: ba23-jA3-nNMj6y\n\n\nNotice that \"ID\" part in trade details? It's made to look up trades. At the top right part of the history, there's a \"Find trades\" sign. Click on it, and a sign will show up in which you can type in a trade ID which you probably got from your friend or a scam rage thread. The ID will also show in the bottom of the chat message after completing a trade. Also, it's possible to disable the possibility to look up your trades or in the API settings (or set it to semi-private like \"friends only\").\n\nPart 2: Trade settings\nTrade settings is a mini option located in the top left corner of the history and seen as redstone dust. The option is pretty much what the name suggest, but like everything here, i'm gonna try to explain it in details. Here's a list of things you can change:\n\n\nSpoiler: Possible options in settings\n\n\n\n-Trade confirmation time: No confirmation, 3s (classic), 5s, 10s\n-Auto-stack items added into trade: Yes, no (classic)\n-Blacklist players from trading with you: (add players manually)\n-Reset sent items to their normal forms (e.g dyed leather armor becomes undyed, and changed name to \"Leather Boots (Colored #9300D3)\"): Yes, no\nand more i didn't think of\n\n\n\nPart 3: Counter-trading?\nI'm really not sure about this one. It can be easily bad, but i'm still gonna put this here.\nClicking on a head in the history allows to send them a counter-trade, even if they're not online. In it, you can choose things from both yours and theirs inventory. They can accept it by seeing a message about a trade being sent in their chat and then accepting/declining by doing the same thing as you did to send. If they were offline when you sent the counter-trade, the message will appear as soon as they join Skyblock. I'm not sure about this at all because offline trading is something absolutely new and is not how trades work and were working since the release of SB.\n\nPart 4: Afterwords\nThis idea is fairly simple and short.\nI see it being useful for sending proofs that you've been scammed primarly, but there's so much more ways this can be used.\nThis one, too, is pretty incomplete. I feel like a lot more can be added to this one, so please tell your suggestions in replies if you want to.\nAgain, bumps are always appreciated. Thank you for reading!\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Deep Caverns Revamp (Revamp): ~9000 symbols!\n\n\n\nThe deep caverns, are, well... deep caverns. You're leaving this area extremely early and probably not coming back expect for getting fairy souls. This revamp should make the Deep Caverns more useful to mid-game and late-game players.\n\nPart 1: Sub-Area: \"The Abyss\"\nThe name probably isn't very original. Maybe i'll change it later.\nThe Abyss is the deepest area accessible in the deep caverns, and is not accessible like the other areas by simply going down or using the lift. None of these will work with The Abyss. Instead, you must find a deep hole in the Obsidian Sanctuary and drop down in the horizontal portal you can't see. There's no level requirement to get down there, but only a small area with monsters as strong as the Obsidian Sanctuary ones can be explored. The rest is blocked by the Lift Operator saying \"You're still very weak to go there... Just like myself. Maybe you should come back when your Combat skill reaches 15? Once you're strong enough, i'll let you pass.\". As you can see from the dialogue, you need Combat 15 to explore the rest of the Abyss because of the strong mobes on the other side. Also, forgot to mention. The Abyss, unlike other Deep Caverns sub-areas, doesn't go down. Instead, it goes to the all the sides and just a little bit up (about 15 blocks difference from the lowest and highest points).\n\nPart 1.1: Monsters of the Abyss\nThe monsters are, well, strong. You already know that anyways. I'll just list the mobs here.\n\nLiving Void: Zombie with 25,000 health. Has leather armor dyed black. The classic monster in the Abyss, met fairy often.\nPalace Guard: Skeleton with 35,000 health. Just like Living Void, has black leather armor. You start noticing them as you go to the right, where the Gray Palace is located. They start appearing rarely, but as you go closer to the Gray Palace, they will be appearing more often.\nOld Guard: Zombie with 40,000 health. Has iron armor. As you walk into the Gray Palace, Palace Guards are replaced by Old Guards. which move 20% faster than the easier mobs in the Abyss.\nTo the mob drops. Living Void drops from 2 to 10 Rotten Flesh, as well as Enchanted Obsidian with a 5% chance.\nPalace Guards drop from 2 to 10 bones, as well as a random piece of Golem Armor with a 1% chance.\nOld Guards drop from 5 to 15 Rotten Flesh, as well as an Empty Artifact with a 1% chance.\nEmpty Artifact can be used at the Altar in the Gray Palace to speed up the time left until Intelligent Emptiness spawns by 20 minutes. Also, speaking of Intelligent Emptiness...\n\nPart 1.2: Intelligent Emptiness\nIntelligent Emptiness is the boss in the Abyss, an ender dragon. It spawns every 2 hours in the Gray Palace. When it spawns, all the Old Guards will despawn. The boss has 20M HP, which is quite a lot. And it becomes even more, because all the damage higher than 125,000 only deals 100,000.\nThe attacks, unlike others, deal a % of your current HP instead of an amount of damage. The attacks are: Rush - The boss rushes at a random player, dealing 40% of your their health. Meteor - A warning comes in chat. 3 seconds after, a meteor falls on every player from the sky dealing 25% of their max health. Meteors fall slowly, so you have time to avoid them. Rage - Activates at 50% health and lasts for the rests of the fight. Meteors fall 25% faster and rush deals 50% of a player's current health instead of 40%. Call - A lot of Living Void starts spawning right outside of the bossfight room and come towards the players. Call happens at 25% health and lasts for 10 seconds spawning 2 LV per second, for a total of 20 Living Voids. Final Blow - The Intelligent Emptiness blows up 5 seconds after death, instakilling everyone who came in range. This attack is very unlikely to hurt anyone, as death will probably happen high up in the air.\nThe drops are pretty decent. The I.E always drops 1-50 obsidian, 1-10 ench. obsidian and 1-3 \"Parts of Emptiness\". RNG drops, of course, exist. Did you think we're not in skyblock? The boss drops a random piece of Void Armor with a 5% chance, or 20% chance for those who got in the Top 3 of damage leaderboards shown at the end of the battle. All the Void Armor pieces have the same stats:\n\nPart 1.3: Void Armor statistics\nVoid Armor is leather armor dyed gray. The statistics are:\nOne Piece | Full Set\n+210 Health | 840 Health\n+120 Defense |480 Defense\n+20 Strength | 80 Strength\n+5 Speed | 20 Speed\n+2 Crit Chance | 8 Crit Chance\nIt also has a neat Full Set Bonus: Void Creature - This set of armor makes you a shade, making mobs notice you only when you're 2.8 blocks near them. Hitting a mob with a sword when invisible deals 50% more damage, but only works once on a single monster. Once the ability is used up, the same monster will see you in their normal range.\n\nPart 1.4: The Abyss design\nThe Abyss is made mostly in gray and light gray colors, with a bit of black. There's no ceiling in this area, and all the action happens on small islands located about 2 blocks between each other. Falling in between small islands causes death. The Gray Palace, however, is made in 50/50 white and gray colors, with pillars and more. It has a few large rooms, and a huge throne room. Above the big throne, the Intelligent Emptiness spawns every 2 hours. Behind the throne, there's a small altar in which Empty Artifacts can be thrown to speed up the wait by 20 minutes.\n\nPart 1.5: The Abyss ores\nAs i was writing this, i kinda forgot the Abyss is still in the Deep Caverns which is a mining area. So, well. I guess i'll just put it here now.\nThere are all types of ores in the abyss. Like, every single ore. They appear on the small islands, in the floor or sometimes below it. Ores there require the Telekinesis enchant to get. Also, they have a 3% chance to give their enchanted form, and a 0.005% chance to drop their enchanted block form. Quartz can also be found in the Abyss. Yes, i do know about BouncySeal's \"The Void\" thread. Yes, i know it's similar.\n\nPart 2: The Late-Game Expansion\nEveryone knows how useless Deep Caverns are for late-game players. This part is about making the Deep Caverns something a late-game player will go into. So, let's start with the ores. One of the main purposes Deep Caverns have is getting 50 ores for a minion, which makes you completely forget about the Deep Caverns. That's one of the main things why nobody goes here, this place is literally useless because of how slowly it provides materials. How to fix that? As you progress, you unlock more features. The Mining skill is one of the main things Deep Caverns would use to see that.\nAt Mining 15, the ores will now have a 1/50 chance to give their enchanted form.\nAt Mining 25, the ores will have a 1/150 chance to drop their enchanted block form.\nAt Mining 30, more areas will be available. I'll get to that in detail a bit later.\nFinally, at mining 40, something very interesting happens... I'll get to that later.\n\nPart 2.1: New NPC: \"Masterful Miner\"\nThe Masterful Miner is a new NPC found near the main stairs leading to the Deep Caverns. He is mainly used to provide rewards for achievements in mining. Here's a list of rewards:\nMining 10: 5 Enchanted Diamonds\nMining 15: \"Magical Blade\" Enchantment Book recipe\n\n\nSpoiler: \"Magical Blade\" Pickaxe enchantment\n\n\n\nMagical Blade can only be crafted, you can't find it at the Enchanting Table. Its recipe is simple: 1 Ench. Diamonds at each corner (total of 4), 4 enchanted gold at each side (total of 16) and a book in the middle. Magical Blade I gives a bonus 0.4% chance to mine up an enchanted form of an ore. Each level grants a bonus 0.4%, resulting in a maximum 2% bonus chance with Magical Blade V.\n\n\nMining 20: 750,000 coins\nMining 30: 1M coins, Access to hidden areas\nMining 35: 1M coins, \"Pure\" reforge stone\n\n\nSpoiler: \"Clean\" Pickaxe Reforge\n\n\n\nClean is a reforge for pickaxes, granting 5 Defense. It also has a reforge bonus: Get a 10% chance to get triple ore drops. This also applies to enchanted block drops, giving you 3 enchanted blocks with an extremely low chance.\n\n\nMining 40: 5M coins, access to more hidden areas\n\nPart 2.2: Hidden areas\nThere are hidden areas in every Deep Caverns level. They aren't a\u0441tually \"hidden\", instead, they're only accessible with the Lift Operator once you gain permission from the Masterful Miner. The ones accessible from Mining 30 contain: Huge amount of ores, stronger mobs dropping the enchanted version of what the normal mobs of their type dropped (Sronger Lapis Zombies have 5000 Health and drop enchanted rotten flesh, stronger slimes have 2000 to 7000 health and drop enchanted slime). The hidden areas accessible from Mining 40 contain: stronger mobs; even more ores; block versions of normal ores (these also drop their enchanted block versions 20% more often than normal ores), enchanted ores (these ores also drop a random amount of coins when mined, between 1000 and 15000).\n\nPart 3: Afterwords\nWhew, that was a long one. Hope you liked it.\nHonestly, i feel like that's the worst one out of the three. As always, if you have any ideas to improve this one, please do write them in replies.\nAnd yet again, bumps are always appreciated! I spent so much time on this thread...\n\n\n\nFinally, it's done. I will be adding more ideas in future updates, i really like torturing myself i guess. Please do bump this or i will do it myself. It will take me a long amount of time to accept that this thread died. Also, i'm not really good at making ideas honestly. This might be bad.\nI really need feedback for this one, so please take your time to select one part and read it. Again, i really need feedback. I've spent a lot of time on this and i really want to see how did it turn out. Bumps are highly appreciated, too."

    "title": "[IDEA] A New Talisman For More Inventory Managment!",
    "body": "Hi! So, recently I had an idea for a new talisman that will automatically delete an item or items from your inventory. I know people have probably mentioned this before, but I think my idea will be original.\n\nThis new talisman comes in 3 tiers, (Just like the personal compacter) It will have the Vacuum Cleaner the uncommon version, the Vacuum Cleanser, the rare version, and the Vacuum Purifier, the Epic version. Here are some screenshots of each one. (Ignore the redstone tag)\nI didn't include this in the screenshots but each version of the talisman is a Hopper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are these items made?\nSo, I was thinking that this item could be made with something that can be obtained through a mob in f9, or from a chest after slaying Storm.\nThis new item would just be called Wind.\nWind would be used in each crafting recipe for each tier. Here are some screenshots of the recipes and a screenshot of the new Wind item. (The iron amount can be modified)\nP.s. I know some of my screenshots are kinda messed up right now, but this is my first idea thread, so please bare with me. (Just pretend there's a hopper in the crafting slot.)\n\nThe new Wind item. (Ignore the Materials tag)\n\n\n\n\nAnd now here are the recipes.\nThe Vacuum Cleaner Recipe. ( 160 enchanted iron and one Wind.)\n\n\n\n\nThe Vacuum Cleanser Recipe. (5 enchanted iron blocks, 1 Wind, and 1 Vacuum Cleaner.)\n\n\n\n\nThe Vacuum Purifier Recipe. ( 15 enchanted iron blocks, 1 Wind, and 1 Vacuum Cleanser.)\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it work?\nSo, I haven't really explained how this works yet. This item will be like the Personal Compacter. The Uncommon version will have one slot for the item you want to be automatically deleted, the Rare version will have 3, and the Epic version will have 5. This talisman will delete an item automatically from your inventory if you have it selected in the talisman configuration. This idea came to my head when I was foraging on my island with the new tree farm you can make. I was often having to deal with saplings and apples in my inventory because they had the habit of not stacking, and would just fill up my inventory. With this new talisman, you'd be able to just have those get sold directly to the npc for their normal price. If you put an item that can be sold to bazaar in the talisman, it will be sold to the bazaar when deleted from your inventory.\nSwords, armor, accessories, tools, and other things like that can not be put in the talisman configuration. You can only put things in that can be sold to the bazaar, or blocks that can not be sold to the bazaar but will be sold to the npc.\n\nWill this have any dupe glitches?\nThis should not have dupe glitches, as it will use the same function for putting items in the configuration as the Personal Compacter. And there have been no dupe glitches with the Personal Compacter.\n\nUnfortunately, this would not be released till the floor 9 update if admins thought it was a good item, as it requires a new item from floor 9 to craft it.\nBut it kinda makes sense to introduce a new Vacuum talisman with a boss called Storm.\n\nPlease tell me if you think anything should be modified in this!\n(Edit: With items that can be sold at bazaar, I think that they would just go through an instant sell, and not a sell offer. I think that'd break the game a bit, if you and 10000 other people were making a sell offer every 5 seconds.)"

    "body": "Hello, as you may know menacing banana is a youtuber that makes hypixel skyblock related content, and in this post i will be going over WHY he shouldn't be overly hated for the things that he had done. Now we need to know HE SHOULDN'T BE LOOKED AT LIKE AN ANGEL. HE DID WRONG AND HE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIS \"CRIMES\" Anyway let's talk about the first problem.\n\n1 . People overly insulting him for his crimes.\n\nOne of the most popular skyblock youtubers called akinsoft made a youtube video with him explaining why menacing banana is a total bag of rice stealing people's ideas, scamming partners etc. Now he is about 50% right in his video, HE DID OVERREACT TO SOME OF THE THINGS HE HAS DONE.\nAnd the hate he has gotten from the skyblock community\nis awful. For example he already got doxxed. YES, DOXXED which is an actual crime. And, he did apologize to the people he scammed the money from GAVE IT BACK, and lego maestro's newest post was this :\n\n\" Just had a very emotional interview with Menacing Banana, he broke down and was sorry about what he did.\"\n\nReally, people who overly want to hurt him should know that he, menacing banana. Is an actual human being that actually could kill himself, in his discord he told me that he had an actual panic attack so please do not send him more hate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The agroMC situation\n\nMenacing banana actually bodyshamed a youtuber called agroMc and told him that his channel was dead in a private discord call.\nHe acted like a total manchild and wasn't a nice person to be around, and well. That's a really bad thing. Still the hate is too much. But you shouldn't consider menacing as a total angel because he is not one himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The PvpWars Drama\n\nMenacing banana actually scammed his partners a few months ago, it was a bad move that he did, he got bored with that server and didn't record the 2 more videos he promised he would, now let's talk about his actual apologize for his behavour.\n\nIn his newest video he wrote a comment under with his apology and sent a tweet on twitter, which was a good thing that he did, now for the 2nd time or even 3rd time. He did return the money, and it wasn't actually 5000 dollars, it was 2000 dollars and akinsoft actually faked that one.\nThe owners of the network said they were fine because he returned the money and the issue was resolved\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitLonger \u2014 When you talk too much for Twitter\n\n\nTwitLonger is the easy way to post more than 140 characters to Twitter\n\n\n\n\nwww.twitlonger.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, please don't be a dick and hate on him, but yes he understand why people hate on him and listen, he is trying to actually fix his behaviour\nand now, is in one of the worst spots to be in.\n\n\n https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1325526662054862850\n\n https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1325526659139858438\n\ngoodbye, if you found this useful you may actually give me a reaction or something, but i don't want to farm them with my post. Because it would be a bad thing, right? If you have anymore questions feel free to actually message me here, i'll be active (probably)"

    "body": "It's bad by not having a set amount of resources collected, just like the Halloween even, to reach bronze, silver or gold level. Let me explain why:\n\nStarting out with the new update, all buffs you can have are 100% triple crops(300%) but only if you're farming 50, a hoe with Harvesting 5 which grants 62.5% and a legendary elephant pet for +50% = 412.5%. And how likely is it to be farming 50 and own a leg. elephant? Not really as someone who doesn't play 24/7.\n\nThis puts you in a disadvantage with people who already have the new hoes/axes for more crop drops. They have an easier time to get to gold than you do. This will also help them get every hoe to the 3rd tier and receive +50% for their respective crops.\nThe rich get richer and the poor get poorer."

You must have some serious brain damage if you think fish minions make you stonks?\". Nowhere in that sentence am I discriminating against a certain group of people. And before people say it's the part where I say he/she has brain damage, I am not discriminating against people with brain damage. Nowhere in that sentence do I say that people with brain damage are babies or something, I'm saying that the person must have brain damage.\nA bit of context: Some guy posted a thread where he was asking why people thought that fishing minions were bad. I responded saying that fishing minions with no super compactors fill up too quickly, and that person couldn't get on every 3 hours to collect their minions, so fishing minions would suck for money. This person then continues to say that from his \"experience\" tier 4 fishing minions make more than tier 5 lapis minions. That's kinda the reason I got so mad, he legit wan't listening to anything anyone said.\nIf any mods read this post, I think that a lot of the \"discrimination\" bans are not actually real. I have heard and seen screenshots of people getting banned for \"discrimination\" for really dumb reasons. In my case, i'm assuming that the mod just saw the words \"brain damage\" and banned me for discrimination. I'm not trying to say that the Hypixel forums mods are terrible, but they definitely need to read posts a bit clearer so these dumb bans don't keep happening.\n\ntl;dr: \"discrimination\" bans on the forums are very random a lot of the time, and mods need to read our posts more carefully.\n\nSkyblock related: While I was banned, I decided to continue my scammer thread, where I try and dumb scammers.\nSo the one I did this time was a MVP+ with endgame gear, and this kinda surprised me, I don't think anyone would be dumb enough to try to scam people and risk losing billions of coins and IRL money. The even dumber part was that he only tried to scam me out of 1.5 mil, which he could probably make in 1 hour. So I ask in the hubs for someone selling a hoe of greater tilling and I get partied by this person. I check his sky.lea.moe and his api is on, but then I refresh the website and than its off. I already knew it was a scam because I had seen the diamond hoe in his inventory that he was gonna use to scam me. Then he does the backpack scam, leaves the party, and ignore adds me.\nThis is one of the dumbest scammers I have ever met. The fact that an MVP+ endgame player is trying to scam 1.5 mil from me. He is legit risking a bunch of coins and IRL money to get 1.5 mil.\nFirst Scammer Test: https://hypixel.net/threads/poll-scam-trials-1.3408881/\nTell me if you want me to continue doing this, and any scammers you want me to test.\n\nEdit: Please actually read my post, people keep saying i'm \"ban evading\" or my \"scam reports won't go through\" even though that wasn't the point of this post."

    "title": "Inflation 2.0 ?",
    "body": "One of the main reason that inflation happen is minion, as it generate stuff over time and selling it to npc gives more coin to the economy, thus inflation(just an example), with the new farming contest update, it encourage people to actively harvest their large scale farm, generating many item at a rate much faster then before. with price of E pumpkin drop below 640(npc sell price) player is more likely to sell their crops to npc. A silver medal(from my past 3 contest) is about minimum 32k pumpkin harvested , that is about 128k coin added per person, not to mention that gold medal is about 81k pumpkin harvested, which is 324k per person. assuming only 5k of the player join each pumpkin contest and each person only earn the lowest of their rank and on average 7 pumpkin contest were held. That is an addition 1.967 Billion coin added per day just with by pumpkin contest, about 70% of daily snow and cyan minion and number is very likely to be higher as many player harvested much more pumpkin in between ranks. what do u guys think?

It's only 50k! I can get that in 2 minutes! How will that help them???\" \nto my response, I say yes, some endgame players sure can get that much money or even more in 2 minutes. But, I didn't do this \"experiment\" to just help out random people, I wanted to see how much of the early game community cared about others. \n\nAnd so, the Tl;dr is there are still kind people out there and are very grateful you are helping them.

So wonderfull in fact that I think that the creators of skyblock should take inspiration from some of the AMAZING ideas the creators of fortnite have had. This is one of my best suggestions and possibly could make it in the game with a good amount of tweaking. I noticed that fortnite added this amazing dog skin\n\n\n\n\nI believe that something similar to this can be added in skyblock. Currently there is a dog armor set but there are not nearly enough furries in the game. This means that the furry community is not represented well. I also see that soviet aspects of the game are not flaunted enough and that there should be more soviet aspects. For this, I suggest a new npc with challenges:\nSoviet doge npc (embrace the furry side)\n\nThis npc would have 3 challenges and reward you with a furry talismen that covers your screen in furries once every 3 minutes. Here are the three challenges\n\nLapdog:\nDonate 40m to a youtuber mod or helper without anything in return\n\n\nFollower\nFollow a player withing 3 blocks for 1 hour\n\n\nSocialism\nGive 15 begging nons exactly what they ask.\n\nI think that I should get creative mind for this.

I'm concerned if sentences like the skill average one isn't a dead giveaway something is a joke to you.\n\nIts all just grinding. Who tf wants to spend hours of their life on this game. This game is a waste of time. Look at wynncraft, you don't have to grind at all, you just enjoy it. This is what skyblock should be. Anyone with a skill average past 10 is a no life with no friends who probably fails all their classes, probably gonna be lonely forever. Stop playing this game and find something better to do."

    "body": "I want to first specify that this is specifically 1.17. Supposedly, the combat system changed back or something idk if not then ignore me cos 1.8 combat mechanics are wayyy better for skyblock. \n\n\nObviously server stability is gonna play a huge part in hypixel updating versions in general. It's just easier for Hypixel to run on 1.8 (I think it's on 1.8.2), they didn't change to 1.9 to keep the more competetive side of pvp and they have run that way for ages. But 1.17 might actually be good\n\nLoads of new blocks to build new islands and **** with. New mobs, netherite could be used for sets. If the combat systems are the same, the only reasons i see not to update are this:\n\nPeople like and are used to playing on 1.8\nServer stability\n\nBut yeh, I'm sure a lot of people will know more about this then me and will probably make me look dumb but if not then it could potentially be converted to 1.17?"

I dont know the names of the channels or servers, its been a while.\n\nAny user may use real money to buy skyblock gems on the hypixel store, currently $4.99 for 675 gems (which I purchased about 2 hours ago) as the lowest priced and least economical option.\n\nAny item bought with skyblock gems can be traded for in game coins, excluding those that are direct buffs to the player rather than through the consumption of an item. I discovered this after opening the bazaar before writing this and seeing 2.2mil appearing in quick sell, and wondering how 5 stacks of enchanted birch could be sold for that much.\n\nWhat do I make of this?\n\nHonestly, I feel let down by hypixel. They've been amazingly vigilant about trading various in-game items and currency for real money, and I respect that. However now it seems that they're doing it themselves. For the price of 25 bucks, you can get yourself a pigman sword and a set of superior if you target the auction house right. And if you don't, well you can eat a month of booster cookies, collect all your bits, buy stonks, and resell them with compacting X enchants on them, again raking in a decent price and boosting your XP. Not to mention the several hundred enchanted items you could sell. Way less than straight selling the cookies, but you're still opened up to the potential of in-game currency as a result of spending real money.\nI'd like to see something put in place to change this. I think that non-paying players should absolutely be able to access booster cookies in exchange for in-game effort, but maybe we should implement some way to get gems for free that doesn't involve near impossibility (if there is let me know)."

    "body": "Skyblock Stock Brokers\nThe BEST tool to making millions of coins on the bazaar WITHOUT ANY EFFORT\nOVER 2000 POSITIVE REVIEWS\n\n\nWe've done it. We hit an outstanding 10000+ members in just one week. For those not familiar with our bots, I have designed a set of a couple discord bots that track the bazaar 24/7. These bots watch crashes, crafts, flips, and use complicated algorithms to give you the best investments to do so you can make millions of coins, even without any prior bazaar flipping knowledge. Details about the bots are below.\n\n\n\nARE THESE BOTS EVEN LEGAL?\nYes, these bots are completely legal. I use the API provided by Hypixel themselves to do analysis on the bazaar. Since there\nare no ingame modifications, there is no danger of trouble using these bots.\n\n\nSpoiler: MINIKLOON APPROVED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd without further ado, let me introduce the bots that will be making you rich\n\nPERSONAL BAZAAR BOT:\n\nTruly my ultimate pride and joy, you simply input the amount of money you want to put into the bazaar, and it comes up with your own PERSONALIZED investment strategy on how to make the most amount of profit from your capital. This bot requires no thinking whatsoever, and you can rest easy knowing the strategy that it comes up for you will use its advanced algorithm to make sure you are making the most amount of money possible. Additionally, since it factors in demand, it expects all the orders to be filled within 5-10 minutes. It also flags volatile items and filters out unprofitable ones, so that it is made sure you don't lose money! This means you are making each cycle of profit within 5-10 minutes. You can do the math yourself on how much that would make you an hour.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Example of Personal Bazaar Bot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFLIP BOT:\n\nDo you want to do the investing yourself? Are you a more advanced trader looking for the best flips out there? Say no more, as this bot ranks the top ten flips (buy order -> sell order) by both profit per flip possible, and profit percent (the amount of profit divided by the price of the flip, so you get the most bang for your buck). This list scans every item in the bazaar, and updates every 30 seconds.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Example of Flip Bot\n\n\n\nRanked by Profit:\n\n\n\n\nRanked by Profit Percent:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRAFT BOT:\n\nOne of the most profitable things you can do on the bazaar is buy items, craft them into some sort of product, and then sell that product. The hard part is finding which crafts are profitable, as that takes a lot of calculations. This bot scans every craft possible in the bazaar (there are over 100!), and then ranks them in the same format as the flip bot (by profit and profit percent). This bot assumes you are setting buy orders for that item, and then insta-selling the product (no risk involved). Also updates every 30 seconds.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Example of Craft Bot\n\n\n\nRanked by Profit:\n\n\n\n\nRanked by Profit Percent:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRASH BOT:\n\nThis bot is constantly analyzing the bazaar, and it reports any crashes in item prices. It will report both buy and sell order crashes. This is highly profitable as if you are one of the first to react to some sort of crash, you can get that item for insanely cheap prices and sell it for MASSIVE profits. In a single day, there are DOZENS of crashes, each with their own potential to make huge amounts of coins for relatively low investments.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Example of Crash Bot\n\n\n\nBuy Order Crash:\n\n\n\n\nSell Order Crash:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN SUMMARY:\n\nThere is a lot of money to be made with these bots. You can be the first to react to a crash on the bazaar, and make millions of coins in mere minutes. You can do your own analysis with the flip bot, or find easy money profits with the craft bot. If you just want to make money and not think at all, simply use the personal bot and it will tell you exactly what to do.\n\nThe best part? You don't ever have to rely on anyone else to make this money. No giving your coins to someone else, no relying on pings, no chance of a sca\u200em. These bots will always be up, day or night, so that you can make massive amounts of money from the bazaar. This is all allowed and legal, as I am simply doing calculations with the information that Hypixel themselves provide.\n\nUnfortunately because of high server costs and bot fees, we do have to charge a slight fee for full access to our bots (minikloon approved again btw, check our discord for screenshot proof). This is just to help keep the bots running on the server, as I am a broke college student and I can't afford the monthly payments myself. Don't want to pay? No problem! There are tons of ways you can get full access to our bots for free.\n\nWe give a free 30 minute trial, and another 12 hours of free usage if you leave a review on how you felt about the bot (can be good or bad, we don't care!). If you still want to use the bot after that, but can't pay, we give you free access to it simply by being active and talking! As you talk more in the discord channels, your rank increases, and eventually you can have full access to all of our bots without paying!\n\nStart making your millions today. Don't believe me? Come join our discord, and find out yourself.\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler\n\n\n\nhttps://discord.gg/2mzkatJ\n\n\n\n\ntl:dr - Use this bot to bazaar flip, go buy yourself a Superior Armor Set and Enderdragon Pet\n\n\u200b"

My reasoning for this is because regular profiles have such a big advantage over iron man profiles in the case that they can buy cookies and use bits, which means that they can acually get the builders wand and build a big farm way faster than an iron man profile would ever be able to, even with the edition of the new items and they can get better and better stuff just for being in late game already like the addition of being able to become farming level 60 and you know what that means more crops and an easier time getting gold all the time, meanwhile iron man profiles have no chance to become farming level 60 since you have to earn a gold medal to actually get the increased level cap. I could state a lot more reasons but I'll just leave it at this and hope you understand what I'm trying to say.\n\n\nTLDR: Regular profiles and iron man profiles farming contests should be separated ."

    "title": "Useful QOL Ideas",
    "body": "We got a lot of QOL items added with the recent Farm Merchant's Dwelling project being added, but I think there are some more things that could be implemented to further add to the QOL.\n\nIf you like these ideas, please bump to help try to get them added.\n\n1. An item that works similarly to the Prismapump or Basket of Seeds, except for normal blocks. Having to place things like slabs for a pumpkin farm or sea lanterns for a potato farm is fairly time consuming. This item, whatever it's named, will place a row of blocks until it hits an obstacle.\n\n\n2. Region Delete tool. It may be quite easy to place blocks now, but removing them is something completely different. This tool will allow players to select a specific region, then delete the selected region. Things like chests and item frames can be exempt to make sure valuable items aren't deleted.\n\n\n3. Personal Compactor. Just a plain Personal Compactor, no fancy numbers or anything. This item will work similarly to a personal compactor 4000/5000/6000, except instead of compacting items into their enchanted form, items will be compacted into their block form. This would make it so it is possible for wheat to automatically be compacted into enchanted hay bales, as well as being a good item for beginners to use to compact ores they mine early on in the game.\n\n\n4. Make the last version of Euclid's wheat hoe cheaper. No one in their right mind would get the last version of Euclid's Wheat hoe. Every other crop-specific hoe has a last version that is significantly cheaper.\n\n\nSpoiler: Reasoning\n\n\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean just the amount of coins it takes to craft, but the amount of raw items it takes as well. Every other crop-specific hoe needs around 6.5 million raw items or less. The Pythagorean Potato hoe needs 6.5 million normal potatoes, the Turing Sugar Cane hoe needs 6.5 million sugarcane, the Newton Nether Wart hoe needs 6.5 million nether wart, and the Gauss Carrot hoe only needs around 5.2 million. The price of these hoes varies, but it's usually around 14.5 million for the cheapest (Sugar Cane), and around 21 million for the most expensive (Nether Wart). I would say that's a fair price considering hoe good they are. Now, I would say Euclid's Wheat hoe is certainly not fairly priced. It needs over 47 million wheat. On top of that, it requires tightly-tied hay bales, which require enchanted hay bales, which are very difficult to get as of right now since there is no way to automatically compact wheat into enchanted hay bales. To get all those materials, it costs at least 250 million coins if the enchanted hay bales are bought cheap.\n\n\n\n\nThanks for reading"

    "body": "One day I thought to myself on where I was going to store some of my much rarer items. So began the construction of one of my most ambitious projects yet \"The Dark Treasury\" as already mentioned this was originally meant to be a place to showcase some of my more rare items, the build was too big and that was when it hit me. This wasn't just going to be a place where I displayed my rare items but a place where the community can showcase theirs too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently the complex consists of two floors that being the lower floor located in the centre and then the upper floor wrapping around the lower one. Right now there are only display cases on the bottom floor as we simply do not have enough items to exceed the bottom floors capacity, the upper floor will be used if necessary. A lobby is also situated at the entrance of the building to direct players in and give them all the crucial information required about the Dark Treasury. The five pedestals at the end of the building are guild related and so are not relevant in this post. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply just login to Hypixel, enter skyblock and type /visit Centranos. You will then spawn in at the lobby where you can read all about the build and it's purpose along with some rules.\n\n- For the best visual experience ensure the following settings are correct.\n- Have night vision disabled\n(This can be done by either toggling the potion effect in the booster cookie menu or by removing the night vision charm/despawning your bat pet if active.)\n\n- Have your brightness setting set to moody.\n(Esc > Options > Video Settings > Brightness.)\n\n- Full bright/ Gamma mods are disabled\n(If you can see the entire treasury lit up then it wouldn't be the dark treasury XD)\n\nIf the island disallows visiting/the wooden doors are closed in the lobby this means that the Dark Treasury is currently closed for either maintenance or I personally don't want to be disturbed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two ways to display your items, either you sell them to me or you donate them to me. If you sell them to me then they will just be placed in the hall. However if you donate items to me then your items shall be placed in the hall and your name/item donated shall be put on the wall of donations located in the main Dark Treasury lobby. We however must be in compliance with the Hypixel Skyblock abusive trading guidelines so each donation will be reviewed before proceeding.\n\nItems that I am specifically looking to buy are as followed\n- cluck the fish (idk if anyone has it)\n- Gamebreaker (Ready to be broke XD)\n- Placeable Heads\n\nIf you are interested in donating/selling items to me then either start a forum conversation with me or send a message in game. \n\nHave a great day/night and I hope that this is the start of something wonderful.\u200b"

My argument for legendary however is you can squeeze more XP out of it. I really am curious as to what I should do. I've already leveled two legendaries to 100 (mine and my coop's) so I was wondering what I should buy to level and resell.\nAlso: if anyone wants a pet leveling service for their silverfish add me in game  (Rare+)"

An RNG I book can be obtained as a rare drop (1/100) from a Sea Giant. The Sea Giant is a legendary fishing mob that has 20,000,000 health, and throws the player up 30 blocks into the air, dealing lots of damage and then 50x the fall damage. The only weakness of the Sea Giant is that it is slightly slower than most fishing mobs. An RNG V book would be very expensive to make, but very good. You can obtain RNG VI as a rare drop (1/100) from the Sea Titan, a legendary fishing mob that is extremely rare to find. The Sea Titan has 50,000,000 health, and shoots lasers at the player when they are in line of sight, dealing high damage per second. It is faster than the Sea Giant, and throws the player 60 blocks into the sky, and then 100x fall damage. Even though the Sea Titan is classified as a mini-boss, it is the hardest mob to kill in the game."

I don't have enough money to reasonably grind higher dungeon floors, and without the gear, I will be left in the dust. This post is a suggestion to make content suiting me, and everyone in the stage of game similar to me. \n\nIGoByLotsOfNames researched what percent of the player base is in which stage, and 48% of the playerbase is similar to me, so I know my problem is a plague infecting almost half of the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n time stamp 1:46\n\n\nAlright, lets get in to the suggestion. My idea is similar to dungeons, as you start in a hub, and find a que with other players instead of randomly trying to enter a party with completely random players, having completely random gear and weapons, your inventory and stats would get scanned, and based off the level of gear using gear score, you would be placed in another party with similar stats. There would be 3 person parties instead of 5, as waiting for 5 other people with your stats could take long.\n\nBased off your collective gear score and skill levels, you would be put in some sort of coliseum, with a wide range of difficulty of mobs. Everyone remembers how difficult and fun the end was at the beginning, and that would be the goal. There would be different drops from the mobs you fight in this arena, and those drops would be specifically used for that arena, so it wouldn't be overpowered in other parts of Skyblock. \n\nWith this idea, Skyblock wouldn't become boring, and the players similar to me, who can't play dungeons, would get a challenge, never getting bored with the game."

    "body": "Hi this is my first thread so go easy on me (or rather don't and tell me everything I did wrong lmao) If I missed anything or you want to add something just let me know!\n\nHALL OF BOSSES\n\nOverview: This would be a series of bosses that would range from extremely easy to incredibly difficult to even impossible (to prepare for future damage increases which are inevitable)\nOn release there would be only 1 boss (I'll explain why later), the first could be completed around the time you unlock the end and the 10th one would be EXTREMELY difficult in the games best gear. It would require groups of overpowered people to join together and try to take just one of these down. I think that this would work like the magma boss where it happens every 2 hours so it is accessible to everyone. I actually think the magma boss would be the first of the bosses as it can be easily defeated by a single person with aiming on their bow. The bosses stats such as health/damage would change depending on how high up the ladder this boss was. These bosses would grant combat xp as a way to get good amounts of combat xp based on how difficult the boss is to kill and how well you did in damage (there would also be loot drops but I don't know what to do for those) Defeating a boss for the first time in the top 3 would grant you 1 perk from that boss and would also allow you to continue to the next boss\n\nOther Notes:\nThe Admins (assuming this would actually get added) would have to prepare a few bosses in advance because the only way for the community to unlock the next boss would be to kill the current highest boss in under a single minute (this could be tweaked depending on how long the dialogue/boss fight takes without the killing the boss part) and they would have to prepare enough bosses where the highest one SHOULD be impossible for like 20+ people in the best gear in the game (Im talking like 1 billion+ health and ridiculous DPS.\nI don't want to go into the details of EVERY single boss because 1. I think part of the reasons most mega threads are never even considered by the Admins is because they don't give the Admins any creativity liberty for there work and 2. because I have like no ideas lmao. Although a few IDEAS and these are ideas only that I are shown here (their stats would be based on which boss it was):\n\nBoss 1: (note this doesn't have to be the first boss it's just the first idea)\nRoom 1: This would be a massive room that was based like you were underwater and in a coral reef. There should be enough coral to allow the player to hide and heal but not enough to make it feel like you're constantly running into it / enough to make the boss get stuck constantly making it super easy to kill. Note: you wouldn't literally be underwater.\n\nBoss Fight: Maybe you would be fighting like a siren or an underwater witch or something I don't know the actual entity that is the boss isn't really relevant but you can decide and let me know I guess. The bosses damage strategy would be based on DPS (so like 50% attack speed roughly and no true damage/ferocity) for the first phase of the boss fight the boss would try to shoot little beams of water (could be moving blocks of water or something created with particles) which would kind of freeze you in place in a way because of the damage ticks. Phase 2 would begin when the boss gets down to half health, The first thing the boss would do would to be go to the center of the room and rise off of the ground about 5-10 blocks. The boss would then release a massive shockwave that would 1 shot any player at the recommended level for this room. The players could survive by hiding behind coral or killing the boss while he is rising. Note: assuming the shockwave doesn't hit any coral/blocks, it would go to every corner of the room. If the boss was not defeated in the next minute or so, it would do this again (the groundpound type thing takes around 10 seconds for the whole process) and this would repeat until the boss was dead. During the time where he isn't in this process, he would act the same as in phase 1. \n\nBoss Perk: 1% more Sea Creature Chance\n\nBoss Drops: Maybe something to do with fishing (please suggest something for this in the comments)\n\nOther Notes: Aiming would not work on this boss to prevent bow spamming, the boss would drop things in the same way that the Magma boss, Dragons, and Endstone Protectors drops items.\n\nSUGGEST MORE THINGS TO ME IN THE COMMENTS"

    "title": "[IDEA] Some balancing on new farming update",
    "body": "I've been experiencing the new update on farming like almost everyone else and I believe there should be some small balancing changes.\nHere they are, ordered on what I think is more important first. Keep in mind, that's just my opinion.\n\n1. Nether warts giving alchemy exp\nI understand why it does and I know it's been like that since the start of skyblock, but I also think that, since it's part of a farming event that comes from a farming update, it should give farming xp.\n\nProblem:\nRight now, farming a nether wart gives 1xp whereas farming a sugar cane gives approx. 1.76xp if brewed from e. sugar cane (xp boosts excluded) so, except for the easier gold medal, there are absolutely no reason to farm it.\n\nAnother point is that the turing nether warts hoe give bonus farming xp, which is absolutely useless on a hoe meant for farming something that gives alch. exp.\n\nSolution:\nI see two possible solutions, there definitely are more, but this is my post so it's my opinion.\n\nIn a perfect world, I'd like to see nether warts give farming xp instead of alchemy. I also think that it could have a balancing in term of quantity of xp given, but I don't know about crops xp to propose anything.\n\nIf the farming xp way isn't possible (maybe because admins think that nether warts are meant to give alch exp, which I can understand) I'd like to suggest some small balancing with the current system.\nFirst, the hoe really should give alch exp bonus instead of farming. I think it's reasonable.\n\nSecond, I think we should up the given xp to something like 12 or maybe even 15xp per wart. Let me explain how did I come up with that number.\nAs I said earlier, a single harvested cane gives 1.76 alch. xp (45000 / 25600) when converted to e. sugar cane.\nHere's my setup for farming cane, which I think is at most average, if not under.\n- Farming 22 -> 88%\n- Sugar cane hoe -> 10%\n- Turbo cane 2 -> 10%\n- Harvesting 5 -> 62.5%\nWhich is 170.5% harvesting bonus so about 2.7 canes per broken cane, but, when farming cane, you harvest 2 blocks per broken block, so everytime you break a cane block, I'd get on average 5.4 canes, which is about 9.5 alch. exp per block broken.\nOn the other hand, warts only give a single exp per block broken.\n\nNow, I proposed 12xp because I'd like warts to be a substiantially better way to farm alch exp than simply farming cane and cane could be the more expensive but faster way of farming alchemy because, right now, I can spend 50m+ to max out alchemy or I can farm canes all day long but sugar cane is still the only real way to max out alchemy.\n\nSo 12xp would be good but why did I say even 15xp? Because warts take so-damn-long to grow.\nAn hour (real time) after harvesting and my farm is still only about 80% regrown, with some patches everywhere.\nWhereas my sugar cane is fully regrown only 30/40 min after harvest and my cocoa one only takes about 15/20min until I see that beautiful wall of brown bean.\n\nSo yeah, if we don't go to warts giving farming exp, I think that's the changes we could do and, even if we do change it to farming, I still think that 1xp is not enough to make it worth anyone's time.\n\n\n2. Coco chopper almost not bringing anything new\n\nProblem:\nEvery new farming item gives more collection in some way of another. Hoes give a straight up bonus to number of collected items whereas melon and pumpkin dicers gives a RNGesus drop.\nIt also doesn't give bonus farming exp, which every other tool does.\nLike right now, the only reason I bought a coco chopper is because I destroyed my wall way too many times with my replenish treecapitator (please don't judge, I was too lazy to craft another gold axe)\n\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we could add either a flat 5% farming exp bonus on it or a scaling one like hoes do.\nSecond since replenish already exist, I think that we could change that passive ability to something that gives bonus collection. It could be as simple as copying the pumpkin/melon RNG drop and it would a huge improvement in my opinion.\n\nEdit 1:\nI just tested it and it's replenish ability doesn't work like the enchantment does. If you break a not fully grown cocoa block, it doesn't replenish, which forces the user to care about which block they break instead of just going ham and breaking everything, which makes it exactly the same as using a normal golden axe with replenish.\n\nWith the normal axe, you need to be careful about not breaking logs\nWith the coco- chopper, you need not to break unrippened cocoa beans.\n\nTo solve this, I think that making it so that the chopper can only break fully grown cocoa block would be nice.\n\n3. Can't add harvesting to axes\n\nProblem:\nWe have a brand new farming update with 3 new farming tools that are axes, yet we can't add the most basic farming enchantment to it (outside of telekinesis).\n\nSolution:\nLet us add harvesting 5 to axes, if someone decides to add it so their raider axe, it's their will to do so."

The question is, during the farming events, I have been able to place bronze and silver a couple of times and I have been rewarded with enchanted books (as well as the usual tickets). These books grant a %5 increase in the chance for double crop drops. Since my percentage is already at 100 for double drops, do the stats somehow stack? Or are these books useless to me??

    "body": "I think that there should be an island after the end island called the plain of ultimate death, it will have wither mobs as the enemies. \nRight after you come here the first enemy you see is the baby wither skeleton with 1 million health and 1000 dps.\nThere are 6 areas with stronger and stronger mobs, each is the size of the end island and contains 5 unique mobs, aswell as an in depth boss battle between a strong wither ranging in health from 50 million, to 10 billion, and 5000, dps to 60000 dps aoe attack. \nEvery single mob drops a unique pet aswell as a powerful wither themed armor set, the bosses each drop 3 swords, one mage, one powerful all around sword, and one sword which deals alot of damage against withers. \nThere will be a new skill called withering which gives 10 ferocity per level, and is leveled by killing wither mobs and using wither items. \nThen there's a one in 10000 chance for each mob to drop a key, getting every key will unlock a specialised door at the end of the island permanently for you. \nHere you can fight the dual boss between wither king and mutant dragon every 4 hours, they will drop the most op gear in the game but only one drop from both if you dealt atleast 1b damage. \nThis gear is not sellable on ah and requires withering 50 to obtain and use, one of the drops is a withered heart which when crafted with a legendary lvl 100 enderdragon non tierboosted, and a legendary lvl 100 wither skeleton non tierboosted will get you the withered dragon pet which gives 100 of every stat and has every pet ability\n\nAnyway that was my short little idea, hope this get's added ty admins in advance love ya guys!"

    "title": "Another recent Dungeon tale with Zhirst",
    "body": "So as tradition its time for my weekly dungeons progress thread, nothing weird happened tbh, until 5 minutes ago, I was on f2 doing my mage duties clearing rooms and spreading incoming doom. We make it to scarf after an ungodly amount of time since a single aa ko'ed a good chunk of us, (including me but my frames dropped I have an excuse). We make it to scarf and murder his toys, and then scarf spawns and my team is dead, just me. I was just a simple mage, not even a bulky mage I was running dark goggles for damage since I didn't die as much. So I pissed my pants and ran for my life. Using my frozen scythe I stalled out enough time for one of my teamates to spawn, it was the protector dragon armor dude and he died. So I ran even more sweating from my pits. Then finally another teamate spawns. Dead immediately, and then scarf delivers this line \"yare yare daze\" and then he lifted up. I slowly realize about what he was going to do,so I did what I do best, run again. I manage to chip down the pric- I mean priest and my opportunity spawns, a teammate spawns and scarf targets him which gives mr time to heal with my manaflux and he dies. Not like we were getting an S anyways. He chips scarf just enough for my frozen scythe to pick up the k.o, and I fall from exhaustion. And that was the story on how I \"soloed\" scarf in **** gear\n\nMoral of the story: Don't do dungeons with protector users, and floor 2 is just as bad as floor 1"

There would be 10 waves and 2 boss waves.

Assuming one booster cookie is around 960k and provides 4,800 bits, the upgrade is worth 1.6M coins. Therefore, the cost to get 10 Ultimate Candy is 8 * 1.75M + 1.6M = $15.6M.

I realize there was nothing I did right with the PVPWars situation. I exploited a server's willingness to give me money and it was wrong. I can't even begin to explain how sorry I am to the people disappointed in me. It was a ****ty thing to do and I don't know why I did it. To be honest, it wasn't even about money. I stopped playing the server because I have the attention span of a two-year-old and I just didn't enjoy it any more. I could have paid them back at any time, but I chose to only do it as of two nights ago when one of my IRL friends heard about the situation. That was selfish of me, and not meeting the terms of a mutual agreement is something one should never do in my position. I am sorry to PVPWars if I financially hurt you in that time and scammed you. I paid them back the entire amount of $1,000 owed as of this morning, but that doesn't fix what I did in the moment. I don't know where Akinsoft pulled this $5000 number from, but that's just not true. I really want to continue making content for you guys. I really want to have time to grow and improve as a person, a friend, and a creator. If you hate me now, I understand, but if all of you would be willing to give me a second chance I would love to prove myself to you. I still have a lot to learn about this platform and a lot to give to this community, so please just allow me to keep creating. As for an actual verbal apology, I feel like making the video on my channel would be sort of exploiting my situation, and for that reason I will be going on Hypixel Alert to try and make some more things known about my wrongdoings. There was nothing excusable about my actions here, and me making a video to profit or gain subs off of it feels inherently wrong. I hope you guys are capable of forgiving me. I love the community I have built more than anything, and I will try and make this right. I will get better, we will get through this. I love you guys. - Menacing Banana\"\n\nHe says we should give him a second chance, which I can agree with. He owned up to his mistake, apologized, and returned the money he took. He will also be on Hypixel Alert to, \"try and make more things known about my wrongdoings.\" \n\nTell me what you think, does he deserve a second chance?"

So I'm not sure if the basket doesn't work for me only or a few other people. It clearly works for some people though.\n\nI've tried lots of different things to try and fix the basket. This included testing smaller areas, dropping it, making sure all the seeds were common, etc. but nothing worked.\n\nWhen I use the basket I place it on the first block of the row I want the seeds on, facing the direction the seeds should go.\n\nAm I using it wrong or is it just broken for me? Also, if it is broken is there a known fix or should I just send in a bug report?"

    "body": "https://hypixel.net/threads/wisconsin-michigan-pennsylvania-and-georgis.3510128/#post-25084718\n\n\n\nHere you can see brainwashed kids from college who think socialism is good.\n\nWhy Socialism doesn\u2019t work, written by an economist with a PhD, Mark Perry\n\n\nIf you are still convinced socialism is good, or are lazy to read, look up what happened to Venezuela they is what will happen to us.\n\nMarch 22, 2016\n\nSlightly more than 20 years, I wrote the article \u201cWhy Socialism Failed\u201d and it appeared in 1995 in The Freeman, the flagship publication of the Foundation for Economic Education. I think it was the first essay or op-ed I wrote for a general audience following graduation in 1993 from George Mason University with a Ph.D. in economics. Note that the title of the article (\u201cfailed\u201d) implied the past tense, as if I perhaps assumed the failures of socialism were so apparent and obvious (I called it the Big Lie of the 20th century) that it would be forever considered only as a discredited system of the past, and never as a viable option going forward into the future! Of course, at the time many parts of the world were moving away from collectivism and central planning and towards free market capitalism \u2013 the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, and China was opening up its economy and re-established the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 1990, etc.\n\nGiven the recent resurgence of socialism, especially as it is now being embraced by young Americans, I thought it might be a good time to re-visit my 1995 essay to review why socialism: a) failed in the 20th century, b) is failing in the 21st century (e.g. Venezuela, see photo above), and c) will always fail. And that\u2019s because it\u2019s a flawed system based on completely faulty principles that aren\u2019t consistent with human behavior and can\u2019t nurture the human spirit.\nHere\u2019s are some excerpts of my 1995 essay \u201cWhy Socialism Failed\u201d:\n\n\n\n1. Socialism is the Big Lie of the twentieth century. While it promised prosperity, equality, and security, it delivered poverty, misery, and tyranny. Equality was achieved only in the sense that everyone was equal in his or her misery.\nIn the same way that a Ponzi scheme or chain letter initially succeeds but eventually collapses, socialism may show early signs of success. But any accomplishments quickly fade as the fundamental deficiencies of central planning emerge. It is the initial illusion of success that gives government intervention its pernicious, seductive appeal. In the long run, socialism has always proven to be a formula for tyranny and misery.\nA pyramid scheme is ultimately unsustainable because it is based on faulty principles. Likewise, collectivism is unsustainable in the long run because it is a flawed theory. Socialism does not work because it is not consistent with fundamental principles of human behavior. The failure of socialism in countries around the world can be traced to one critical defect: it is a system that ignores incentives.\nIn a capitalist economy, incentives are of the utmost importance. Market prices, the profit-and-loss system of accounting, and private property rights provide an efficient, interrelated system of incentives to guide and direct economic behavior. Capitalism is based on the theory that incentives matter!\nUnder socialism, incentives either play a minimal role or are ignored totally. A centrally planned economy without market prices or profits, where property is owned by the state, is a system without an effective incentive mechanism to direct economic activity. By failing to emphasize incentives, socialism is a theory inconsistent with human nature and is therefore doomed to fail. Socialism is based on the theory that incentives don\u2019t matter!\n2. The strength of capitalism can be attributed to an incentive structure based upon the three Ps: (1) prices determined by market forces, (2) a profit-and-loss system of accounting and (3) private property rights. The failure of socialism can be traced to its neglect of these three incentive-enhancing components.\n3. By their failure to foster, promote, and nurture the potential of their people through incentive-enhancing institutions, centrally planned economies deprive the human spirit of full development. Socialism fails because it kills and destroys the human spirit\u2013just ask the people leaving Cuba in homemade rafts and boats [and those waiting in long lines today in Venezuela struggling, and often failing, to buy food].\n4. The temptress of socialism is constantly luring us with the offer: \u201cgive up a little of your freedom and I will give you a little more security.\u201d As the experience of this century has demonstrated, the bargain is tempting but never pays off. We end up losing both our freedom and our security.\nSocialism will remain a constant temptation. We must be vigilant in our fight against socialism not only around the globe but also here in the United States.\nThe failure of socialism inspired a worldwide renaissance of freedom and liberty. For the first time in the history of the world, the day is coming very soon when a majority of the people in the world will live in free societies or societies rapidly moving toward freedom.\nCapitalism will play a major role in the global revival of liberty and prosperity because it nurtures the human spirit, inspires human creativity, and promotes the spirit of enterprise. By providing a powerful system of incentives that promote thrift, hard work, and efficiency, capitalism creates wealth.\nThe main difference between capitalism and socialism is this: Capitalism works.\n\nClick to expand..."

A proof of my threads being agreed and altered was Dealing with forum nons v3, It got 7 positives and was thrown into off-topic sections of the forums. I am extremely infuriated from these events. Do the staff really care about the forums as they discourage voluntary exercises (that makes the forums batter) like anti-sh*tposting?\n\nWhat I suggest the staff to do:\nEither allow anti-sh*tposting movements just like how we repelled forum nons; or, make sh*tposting against the rules, so that us forumers can identify sh*tposters and report it to the online staff, so they could be banned for breaking server rules. Personally I would choose the latter.\n\nHave you been banned for anti-sh*tposting before? And which method do you think is better? Make sure to leave replies and vote in the poll!"

Then, it would open up into a trading section where you can toggle giving or borrowing. \n\nThe 'Giving' panel allows you to put up items, and set a time, both of which are visible to another person, and then the 'Borrowing' Panel, allows you to but up payment of some kind, similar to how a trade would work.\n\n\n\nIf two people select 'Giving' That fine, basically, they will both give items, that will be returned later (Things like collateral or something)\n\nIf two people select borrowing, it becomes a normal trade, as both people give a payment of some kind, without a time limit.\n\nBORROWED ITEMS CANNOT LEAVE YOUR INVENTORY.

Foraging 50 people went from getting an average of 3.9 logs per log broken to just 3.6 (see math spoiler). This is about 7.7% lower. I would hope that the admins change the monkey's perk to 90% so that it is not nerfed for any level of player.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Math\n\n\n\n\nBeforeAfterforaging lvlbase logswith monkeyforaging lvlbase logswith monkeyChange in absolute numbersChange in percent11.041.3511.041.64+0.29+21.5%21.081.421.081.68+0.28+20%31.121.4631.121.72+0.26+17.8%41.161.5141.161.76+0.25+16.6%51.21.5651.21.8+0.24+15.4%61.241.6161.241.84+0.23+14.3%71.281.6671.281.88+0.22+13.3%81.321.7281.321.92+0.2+11.6%91.361.7791.361.96+0.19+10.7%101.41.82101.42+0.18+9.9%111.441.87111.442.04+0.17+9.1%121.481.92121.482.08+0.16+8.3%131.521.98131.522.12+0.14+7.1%141.562.03141.562.16+0.13+6.4%151.62.08151.62.2+0.12+5.8%161.642.13161.642.24+0.11+5.2%171.682.18171.682.28+0.1+4.6%181.722.24181.722.32+0.08+3.6%191.762.29191.762.36+0.07+3.1%201.82.34201.82.4+0.06+2.6%211.842.39211.842.44+0.05+2.1%221.882.44221.882.48+0.04+1.6%231.922.5231.922.52+0.02+0.8%241.962.55241.962.56+0.01+0.4%2522.62522.6no changeno change262.042.65262.042.64-0.01-0.4%272.082.7272.082.68-0.02-0.7%282.122.76282.122.72-0.04-1.4%292.162.81292.162.76-0.05-1.8%302.22.86302.22.8-0.06-2.1%312.242.91312.242.84-0.07-2.4%322.282.96322.282.88-0.08-2.7%332.323.02332.322.92-0.1-3.3%342.363.07342.362.96-0.11-3.6%352.43.12352.43-0.12-3.8%362.443.17362.443.04-0.13-4.1%372.483.22372.483.08-0.14-4.3%382.523.28382.523.12-0.16-4.9%392.563.33392.563.16-0.17-5.1%402.63.38402.63.2-0.18-5.3%412.643.43412.643.24-0.19-5.5%422.683.48422.683.28-0.2-5.7%432.723.54432.723.32-0.22-6.2%442.763.59442.763.36-0.23-6.4%452.83.64452.83.4-0.24-6.6%462.843.69462.843.44-0.25-6.8%472.883.74472.883.48-0.26-7%482.923.8482.923.52-0.28-7.4%492.963.85492.963.56-0.29-7.5%5033.95033.6-0.3-7.7%\n\n\n\n\nOh, and before you try and tell me that the change doesn't affect foraging in this way, I tested it out myself, and this is exactly how it works."

I came out with a new idea so, hope you'll enjoy it!\n\nThe idea is all around a new sea creature, the Frost Archwizard, which can be fished in the Jerry Pond while being Fishing level 26 or more. It is quite similar to the Grim Reaper sea creature from the Spooky Fishing update, but he behaves like a Crypt Witherlord from Dungeons with the ability to float.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, it has two unique drops: the Frozen Tissue and the Frost Core. Also, he drops between 2-5 Frozen Tissues upon death.\n\nFrozen Tissues are used to craft a brand new armor set, the Frost Wizard Armor, which is made for a mage setup. It could be used for Dungeons ( the set could be converted into a dungeon set using Ice Essence, dropped from Frozen Adventurers. )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Frost Wizard Armor + Recipes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second item, the Frost Core, is quite similar to the Spooky Fishing's Vampire Fang. The only difference is, the Vampire Fang can be applied to the Bat Pet whereas the Frost Core can be applied to the Snowman Pet.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt makes the Snowman Pet perfect for Ice Fishing by adding a new perk aswell as a bonus +1% ( per 20 level ) Sea Creature Chance.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I do know my idea was slightly based on the Spooky Fishing update, but I'll try to add a bunch of unique stuff in the future when I get more inspiration.\n\nIf you feel like anything could be changed or added, send a comment including it and I'll maybe include it ( if you're fine with it, of course. )\n\nAs for now, have a nice day, take care of yourself!"

While he always admired his brother, Midas swore his kingdom would not end the same way.\" we can see that lore-wise he does have a brother and that something happened to his kingdom but that's about it.\n\nsome more ideas to the Mob: so, I really like Krakens I think they are extremely cool so why not make him ride a squid. if not a squid we can make it so he spawns up to 5 mobs in his life span which are the coral hunters(Btw yes I got this idea mainly from Davy jones)\n\nlately, the fishing updates were great and they introduced Harder sea creatures for example The Great White Shark, the Grimm Reaper, and the phantom fisher\n\nso I want an extremely challenging boss(it doesn't have to be ofc but it'll be kinda cool) and a high fishing skill level requirements\n\nHope the idea catches someone's interest.have a good day!"

    "title": "Why did they make mage weapons so op?",
    "body": "Mage was op af, since there were really good magic dmg spam weapons like fs and bonzo staff, and not spammable, but very powerful weapons like ink wand and pigmans. Bc of that, they \"nerfed\" mage by slightly nerfing how ability dmg works, and also made some weapon abilities worse. But with nerfing mage woweee they added the spirit sceptre, a spammable weapon with really good damage. This was actually a buff to mage due to how op the spirit sceptre was. Mage was still the best class in terms of dps due to splash damage, and magic dmg usually outclassing regular dmg. F5 came, berserk got a huge buff due to sa armor, a new dps set, the livid dagger and flower of truth, the new best weapons. Mage was still better bc of yeti sword, and then they released the midas staff. Idk how they thought adding a better weapon to the already seriously op magic damage/mage class, not in the way most items get buffed like 1.2x or something, it almost doubles the damage of the yeti sword. Now getting decent damage without magic damage is impossible on golems, and fs literally took over the end/any type of grinding. Voodoo doll is busted on drags, and using even the best swords will get you no where . Im just saying, stop buffing mage weapons, maybe give the voodoo doll/midas staff a little damage of a nerf, or add some new bows and swords that can compete with the midas staff, like buff the midas sword idk"

This could be a brand new server that Default ranks could access more easily, which would be great! Also, everyone couldn't access their main Skyblock profiles on the second server.

    "body": "So this may get lost in the endless flow of posts saying \"NeRf FroZen BlaZe ArmoR\" or \"I'Ve FouNd a GamEbReakIng GliTch\", but I've come to the conclusion that as a community, we need a modpack that refines this online cobblestone mining simulator into a real RPG, the way it should be.\nI've taken some time to think about what Mods would make Skyblock feel special.\nI have looked at what makes an RPG so immersive. This is mainly the graphics, the soundtrack, the ambience, etc.\nI have looked at many Minecraft mods and came up with the best solution to this I can.\nI even installed a Skyblock resourcepack to give the items custom textures, however, I know some people prefer the PvP texturepack feel, so I've tried to cater to everyone.\nThere\u2019s only 18 mods included so far, so let me know if you have any ideas.\nJust watch the trailer to see what you think:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo this modpack has many features, I'll list a few here:\n\n\nCustom Soundtrack to Enhance the RPG Feel.\nCustom textures for 99% of the items in Skyblock\nShaders and visuals for low to high-end systems\nDynamic ambient noise which changes to match your environment.\nUpdated for every Skyblock Addons update so you never need to go out of your way to update\nZealot counter to keep track of eyes and kills\nAFK FPS Reducer to save power when AFKing.\nAlso some people in the comments seem to be confused about what mods are actually present in the pack, so these are what\u2019s in the modpack as of release 0.7.4.\n\nAmbience\nAutoTip\nBetterFPS\nBlur\nCustomMainMenu\nDynamic Surroundings\nFoamfix\nFullbright\nItemPhysic Lite\nMouseDelayFix\nNoCloseMyChat\nOptifine\nResource Loader\nShoulder Surfing\nSidebar Mod\nSkyblock Addons\nFPS Reducer\nZealotCounter\n\n\nSo that's about it. I think the trailer speaks for itself. If you think this is something that interests you,\nhead over to https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/skyblock-enhanced-hypixel.1577429 to download it!\n\nThe reason I have used technicpack rather than just releasing a mod folder is so that it will automatically update for you when I modify the pack. I will not release it as a mod folder. Technic is a trusted resource and allows for easy updating of the modpack. \n\nI do not take any credit for any of the mods in this modpack.\nThanks,\ntrolliver."

    "title": "Necron Boss Fight [High-Effort Post] [140+ Positive Reactions]",
    "body": "In my mind, the Necron boss fight is meant to be an elegant and difficult boss fight that is not meant to be completed really quickly.\nIt would have multiple phases.\n\nNote: It is highly recommended to have no duplicate classes for a phase in the fight.\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 1\n\n\n\nPhase 1:\nNecron: Enough of this. I grow tired of your weak amusement.\nLost Adventurer: No, please!\n*Necron smites the LA*\nNecron: Now, who's next? I do hope you can keep me entertained for at least a while.\n(First time going in the dungeon Necron dialogue :) \nNecron: Ah. Yes. I've heard of you adventurers, smiting each of my wonderful generals floor after floor. Every time I expect you to fail and every time I am disappointed. And yet, I'm overjoyed. I'm overjoyed because an irritating pest will finally be eradicated!\n\nIn Phase 1, Necron summons hordes of mobs from every angle. The objective of this phase is to damage Necron to 80% health while not dying. Necron has different states where only a specific class can hit him (Notably this is why no duplicates is recommended.)\nThe 5 states are:\nNecron: Your blades fall to my splendour! No-one but a mage could leave a scratch on me!\nNecron: Your health pales in comparison to mine! No-one but a tank could hurt my pride!\nNecron: Your weapons lay decaying from my wonderful barrier! Nothing but an arrow from an Archer could leave a scar!\nNecron: Your magic is useless against me! Unless a berserker struck me with his sword, I should be immortal!\nNecron: Your healing is so inferior! Only a healer could damage my reputation!\n\nNecron switches states every 15 seconds, giving ample time for each class to do damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.1 - Bonzo\n\n\n\nPhase 2.1:\nAfter Necron drops 20% HP (Note, I have no idea how much he's going to have so I'm putting it in percentage.)\n\nNecron: I notice your power grows as you crawl the dungeon. Your teamwork makes your strength amplified as you take blessings from my chests. MY chests! It's time for you to feel the consequences of looting what you shouldn't touch.\n\nFor every blessing you find, Necron reduces your health by 2%. This can be DEVASTATING. Notably, if you take no blessings throughout the dungeon run, the maximum score you'd ever get is an S.\n\nThis is a really big phase, as it goes through every single boss again.\nYou get 3 blessings after beating each boss. You can see the items that are in your chests before deciding if you want to take the loot or go to the next phase. Taking the loot ends the run.\n\nNecron: How come you defeated Bonzo? I know he's weak, but he managed to become a general for a reason. Let's replay that fight!\n(You get teleported to the Bonzo fight.)\nBonzo: Thank you for the chance to redeem yourself. Die flashily! (Yes. One Piece reference)\nBonzo has learned how to teleport between each of the pillars you see in the Bonzo room. He also has a significant increase in health and damage. Bonzo is the easiest boss to fight in this phase, but he is not easy. Each time he teleports to a pillar, he stops for exactly 5 seconds and sends out a barrage of balloons. When he is at 50% health, he only stays at each pillar for 4 seconds and shoots balloons twice as fast.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.2 - Scarf\n\n\n\nPhase 2.2:\nAfter Bonzo is defeated, Necron gives you a choice:\nNecron: I am impressed. You managed to defeat my clown! You can quit here and take new and improved items from Floor 1. Alternatively, you can continue on to Scarf's reincarnation. I know he's eager.\n\nLoot you can get:\nCursed Bonzo Staff : The cursed bonzo staff costs 0 mana to cost and has no cooldown. It notably does as much damage as a 5 star spirit sceptre without being starred.\nPainted Iron: 9 of these Painted Iron items will form a Party Cannon, which can be shot at a 5 second cooldown for 1000 mana and does a LOT of damage.\n\nScarf Fight:\nScarf: You told me to train for another 100 years if I wanted to defeat you. I got started, and now I'm here. Its time to dance.\n\nScarf has the ability to summon 5 EXACT COPIES of the 5 player's stats and damage. Meanwhile, he has increased health and damage, and shoots the soul sand spikes occasionally, slowing all the players and debuffing them. When he hits 50% HP, he revives all the copies (if theyve died) and increases their speed by 300%.\n\nWhen Scarf dies, he says:\nScarf: 'Mother... I'll finally be with you again...' (yikes thats kinda deep)\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.3 - Professor\n\n\n\nPhase 2.3:\nAfter Scarf is defeated, Necron gives you the same choice.\nNecron: 'I'm impressed with the way you keep going at my generals. That poor Scarf lost his mother in a terrible accident. Didn't stop him from dying. You can take the loot from this area, or continue on. The Professor is ready to school you.'\n\nLoot you can get:\nScarf's Diary: This is an epic dungeon item talisman. It seems Scarf really held this dear to his chest.\nRidiculously Wise: This is an Ultimate Enchant that reduces the mana cost of items by 7.5% per level, and can go up to level 10.\n\nProfessor Fight:\nProfessor: I'm ready to teach this class. Are you ready to learn a lesson?\n\nThe Professor is in the middle of teaching a class to a school of guardians. The guardians swarm the players, zapping them and stunning them in place. The Professor is stuck in a state of being transformed into a guardian, and occasionally shoots lasers, drops TNT, smites everyone, or just heals everything. He is completely invincible until the guardians are dead, in which case he triggers the four abilities of his guardians (sans healing) thrice as fast. Health and damage is increased etc etc.\n\nWhen the Professor dies, he says:\nProfessor: Hopefully my students take my teachings with them and remember me after I die...\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.4 - Thorn\n\n\n\nPhase 2.4:\nAfter the Professor is defeated:\nNecron: 'Your power is certainly unparalleled. The last batch of adventurers didn't even make it past Bonzo. You can stop here, and take the items from the Professor, or continue on to the next phase.'\n\nLoot you can get:\nMetamorphosis Armour: This is a buffed up version of adaptive that can be worn on any class. It gains 2 strength for every F3 completion you have, up to (insert number here) per piece.\nMetamorphosis Blade: This is a buffed up version of the Adaptive Blade that does (x) amount of damage per hit.\nSuper Serum: This is a REQUIREMENT to defeat F6-10 Necron-ified bosses. Using one Super Serum makes the bosses vulnerable, as without using the Super Serum they are completely invulnerable. It costs 1mil to get it. (yay. deflation!!)\n\nThorn Fight:\nThorn: I appreciate you coming to give another round of entertainment. But it seems my crowd wont take this one sitting down.\n\nIn the thorn fight, lost adventurers, frozen adventurers and shadow assassins all come, paired with the constant spirit animals flowing down. The Spirit Bear has become corrupted and attacks twice as fast. Upon killing the Spirit Bear, Thorn automatically gets damaged so you don't need to worry about hitting shots. Each death enrages the mobs, making them 10% faster. Thorn himself joins the fight, shooting fireballs that deal 2500 True Damage per hit, but move pretty slowly.\n\nWhen Thorn dies, he says:\nThorn: At least it was fun. Please don't hurt the animals, we vegans would hate to see that happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.5 - Livid\n\n\n\nPhase 2.5:\nAfter Thorn is defeated:\nNecron: 'Livid is, well, livid. Meet him in the next room, or grab the loot from here. Although I recommend bringing something special, otherwise you might not survive.'\n\nLoot you can get:\nPulsating Spirit Wing: Crafting three of these will make a Pulsating Spirit Sceptre, which costs 100 mana per use and deals (x) amount of damage per hit.\nPulsating Spirit Bone: Crafting this will make a Pulsating Bonemerang, which has no distance limit and comes back regardless of hitting a wall. It also does (x) amount of damage per hit, increasing by 10% each time it hits a consecutive enemy in one throw.\nSuper Serum\n\nNOTE: From here on out, there is absolutely no way to kill the bosses without using a Super Serum. If you lose the fight, the Super Serum is gone for good. It takes one Super Serum per fight continuing on.\nNotably, it is impossible to kill the bosses with F9+ gear, and you would need the special items from the previous floors.\n\nLivid Fight:\nLivid: I feel amazing. I feel immortal. Don't you?\nIf even one party member has a Super Serum, this is the opportunity to right click it and multiply every party member's stats by 10. You can do this in earlier floors, but this is basically necessary to fight F5-10 copies.\n\nLivid spawns 9 clones that are super buffed up. When a clone is sub (x) amount of health, they teleport away to regenerate at a rate of (x) per second. This means it is impossible to use cheese tactics such as the eagle strat as the lower HP livids will TP away. You have to be able to chase and track down each Livid. Notably, you have to kill all 9 to win the fight, and they don't respawn.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.6 - Sadan\n\n\n\nPhase 2.6:\nNecron: 'It astonishes me that you found my serum. I'm kind of angry. Well, Sadan should take care of you just as good. That is, if you choose to meet him.'\n\nLoot you can get:\nFlawless Livid Dagger: This is a livid dagger that grants 50 ferocity on top of 100 cc and 100 attack speed. It also has (x) damage and strength.\nFlawless Shadow Fury: This is a shadow fury that costs no mana and has no cooldown. It also has (x) damage and strength.\nLivid Goggles - Livid Robes - Livid Leggings - Livid Boots: This is an upgraded Shadow Assassin set. It spawns a clone of yourself that does significant portions of damage and takes all mob aggro off you until your clone is dead.\nSuper Serum\nUltra Swarm - Just swarm but 5x better\n\nSadan Fight:\nSadan: Are you ready to die, puny humans?\nIf even one party member has a Super Serum, this is the opportunity to right click it and multiply every party member's stats by 10. You can do this in earlier floors, but this is basically necessary to fight F5-10 copies.\n\nSadan is ready to fight. His 4 giants are standing, and his main body is also there. You don't need to kill the other 4 giants, but they constantly harass you. Sadan's main giant does significant portions of damage, and he has a 5th giant called the Missile Man all the way at the other side of the room. He cannot move, but at the 2 minute mark starts sending huge arrays of missiles that all do true damage. The idea is to either kill the Missile Man or finish Sadan within two minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.7 - Maxor\n\n\n\nPhase 2.7:\nNecron: 'Each of my generals continues to disappoint. Take the loot or be prepared to fight Maxor.'\n\nLoot you can get:\nFluorescent Flower: Crafting 9 of these forms the Flowing Flower of Power. This is a better version of the flower of truth that has a limit of 15 chained mobs and costs 200 mana per usage.\nSadan Goggles - Sadan Robes - Sadan Leggings - Sadan Boots: This is an upgraded necromancer lord set.\nSuper Serum\nUltra Legion - Just legion but 5x better\n\nMaxor Fight:\nI'm leaving this empty because we haven't seen the Maxor fight. I don't want to make any assumptions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.8 - Goldor\n\n\n\nPhase 2.8:\nNecron: Maxor was too young to fight properly. Lets see you up against Goldor, one of the most experienced in my army! Take the loot or be prepared for mortal combat.\n\nGoldor Fight:\nI'm leaving this empty because we haven't seen the Maxor fight. I don't want to make any assumptions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Phase 2.9 - Storm\n\n\n\nPhase 2.9\nNecron: If Storm doesn't stop you now, I'll be forced to deal with you myself. Take the loot while you still can.\n\nStorm Fight:\nI'm going to be putting my interpretation of the Storm fight here. Subject to change when Storm gets released.\n\nStorm: I'm mad. I'm so mad! I feel so cold. So hot. I'm fired up! Prepare to die.\n\nStorm is a sociopath elementalist. with multiple personalities. Every 20 seconds, he changes his personality and the manner of the fight will change.\n\nWindy Storm:\nWhen Storm is in his Wind phase, he sends arrows flying from every direction and anvils falling from the ceiling, meanwhile smiting you with lightning.\n\nFiery Storm:\nWhen Storm is in his Fiery state, he summons Magma bosses and ghasts from the ceiling to attack you.\n\nLiquid Storm:\nWhen Storm is in his Liquid state, he summons Sea Emperors and Great White Sharks to attack you.\n\nStonewall Storm:\nWhen Storm is in his Stonewall state, he summons Gaia Constructs and such to attack you.\n\nKilling Storm ends Phase 2 YES LMAO WE'RE STILL IN PHASE 2 . \n\n\n\nPre-Phase 3:\nNecron: DISAPPOINTMENTS! All of them. Nothing but disappointing. Take the loot or die.\n\nStorm Loot:\nwell i dont know lmao wait for them to make the loot table\n\n\n\nPHASE 3\nNecron himself finally joins the battle. He's ready to roll. He charges a lightning attack for one minute, while summoning swarms of mobs to fight you. If he charges up fully, he starts laughing and completely kills one player at random. The only way to subvert his lightning is to stand on 5 pressure plates behind him, which restarts his charge. Killing all of the mobs forces Necron to fight you himself, where he shoots wither skulls and smites everyone occasionally dealing true damage.\n\nPHASE 4 \nWhen Necron is at 50% HP, he goes berserk. This mechanic comes back:\nThe 5 states are:\nNecron: Your blades fall to my splendour! No-one but a mage could leave a scratch on me!\nNecron: Your health pales in comparison to mine! No-one but a tank could hurt my pride!\nNecron: Your weapons lay decaying from my wonderful barrier! Nothing but an arrow from an Archer could leave a scar!\nNecron: Your magic is useless against me! Unless a berserker struck me with his sword, I should be immortal!\nNecron: Your healing is so inferior! Only a healer could damage my reputation!\n\nEvery mob in the game is summoned all at once (Ranging from a chicken to the Woke Golem to every single boss in the catacombs) and you will have to kill them all. All this while, Necron is still charging his lightning blast. If all the mobs are killed, Necron fights you himself, shooting thrice as fast and smiting way more.\n\nPHASE 5\nWhen Necron is at 20% HP, he attempts to negotiate with the players.\nNecron: You're doing well. I'll give you the chance to open the Obsidian Chest behind me if you end the run here. Just open the chest.\n\nOpening the chest will instantly kill all of the players.\nGEEEEET DUNKEDD ONNNN\n\nHitting Necron will continue the fight. He removes all the blessing buffs from the players and de-equips all their pets. Shuffles their inventory, freezes them in place, and summons even more frozen adventurers and shadow assassins.\n\nPHASE 6\nWhen Necron is at 10% HP, he goes crazy and summons 25 Shadow Assassins. He charges up for 3 minutes, meaning at the end of 3 minutes, every single player dies. If the players manage to kill the Shadow Assassins, Necron finally comes out and fights them, being EXTREMELY POWERFUL.\n\nIf you defeat Necron after all of this, congratulations! You deserve it from me and from necron.\n\nNecron: You... You puny adventurers.. I'll get you for this! You hear me, I will! You'll never survive in the (insert next dungeon name here). My friend (insert friends name here) will make sure of it! *necron warps out*\n\n\nSpoiler: Loot from Necron\n\n\n\nLoot:\nNecron's Skull: You managed to sever off one of his three heads. Might as well wear it. Increases rate of gaining Catacombs EXP by 20% along with other stats\nNecron's Ribcage: You managed to rip out his ribcage. Why not wear it? Increases rate of gaining Catacombs EXP by 20% along with other stats\nNecron's Leggings: He wears leggings? Increases rate of gaining Catacombs EXP by 20% along with other stats\nNecron's Boots: Wait, doesn't he float? Increases rate of gaining Catacombs EXP by 20% along with other stats\n\nNecron's Sceptre: This shoots wither skulls that explode. Best mage weapon in existence for clearing rooms\nNecron's Crossbow: This is just a really powerful bow that does TRUE DAMAGE!. Great for archers\nNecron's Cutlass: An incredibly powerful sword that gives you 300 ferocity.\nNecron's Beating Heart: An upgrade to the plasmaflux which does NOT require Wolf 7 but instead Catacombs lvl 45.\nNecron's Slammer: A sword which stuns enemies when you hit them. Damage and stun duration amplified as Tank.\n\nAnd other stuff too! Its up to the admins.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Some ideas I had for loot\n\n\n\nImpatient - Ultimate Enchant - Gain 1/2/3/4/5% extra damage on your next hit for each second since your last attack, up to a max of 20/40/60/80/100% extra damage.\n\nOverdrive - Ultimate Enchant - The cooldown of this weapon goes down 10/20/30/40/50%.\n\nArm for an Arm - Ultimate Enchant - Take 50% more damage from all sources. Deal 40/80/120/160/200% of that damage reflected as true damage to the next enemy you hit. Cooldown of 2 seconds.\n\nSoul Piercer - Tank Weapon - This weapon deals its damage + your ehp as true damage per hit.\n\nPacifism - Ultimate Enchant - Take 10/20/30/40/50% less damage and deal 35% less damage.\n\nGreed - Ultimate Enchant - Gain 2/4/6/8/10 Magic Find.\n\nOverpowering - Ultimate Enchant - Deal 10/20/30/40/50% more damage and take 100% more damage.\n\nBroken Claw - Reforge Stone - (Legendary) Adds 35 Ferocity to the weapon.\n\n\nSOME CLOSING NOTES:\nUpon killing a Necron Converted Boss i.e. Bonzo v2, you do NOT have to fight it again if ALL 5 PLAYERS have killed Bonzo v2. Instead, Bonzo v2 can be fought in the Master Mode for F1. Same goes for all the floors.\nSuper Serum does NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT work in the overworld.\nIts meant to take hours to complete everything. Notably, all of the resurrected bosses wont be fought more than once (unless you want to farm the items or the Super Serum in Master Mode.) so it wont actually take so long youd want to die\nTHERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY TO FINISH THIS IN ONE SHOT. NO POSSIBLE WAY. You at LEAST need super serum and the items from the revived bosses\n\n\n\nSpoiler: EDIT: Master Mode F10\n\n\n\nsince people were continually asking for F11 or a glitched F10 boss, here it is. master mode f10. I intend this to be extremely difficult.\n\nNecron: You dare return? After you disgraced me so badly? Enough is enough. This is the end for you.\n*Necron takes a crystal and fuses with it (this is a Soul Orb).* This should be enough to defeat you. I am now immortal! I am almighty! I am... EXALTED!\n\nEXALTED NECRON Phase 1 \nExalted Necron is extremely powerful. Throughout the boss room there are five archwizards who all have a beam connected to Necron. They respawn within 30 seconds of being killed, and all immediately respawn if someone dies. They cannot attack but are instead really tanky. As long as even one is alive, Necron is immune.\n\nWhile his archwizards are alive, he does the following attacks:\n\nThe pattern of the floor is a checkerboard pattern with three colours. Every so often, Necron will choose one colour at random and strike lightning on it dealing true damage. This will be indicated by the block turning red. Thats right, for every three blocks, one lightning will strike. \n\nNecron just straight up kills everyone in a 3 block radius from him. Yeah dont go near him while he's Exalted.\n\nNecron summons hordes of skeletor primes to attack you.\n\nNecron goes to the middle of the room and starts shooting arrows in a spiralling motion. For example look at this +.The dot in the middle of the + would be Necron and the lines would be arrows dealing true damage, moving in a circular motion.\n\nWhen his archwizards are inactive they take one minute to respawn. He strikes lightning on two blocks instead of one, and twice as frequently. He sends wither skulls flying in every direction and blinds players, shuffles their inventory, teleports them to random places in the room, and just messes with them. He goes back into that specific phase where only one class can hit him at a time. \n\nGetting Necron to 20% HP makes him send you all to a void in an attempt to stop you from killing him. One player will remain in the boss room (spirit leaps disabled) and he fights one player at a time for 30 seconds each.\n\nObviously, he would do some more cool things but I have a test in like 4 days so I'll stop here. \n\nLoot:\nI can't give any loot, but at least one I must say:\nSoul Orb: Applies the Exalted reforge (Only chestplates) - + x defence and + x health. Bonus Ability: EXALTED! You are Exalted, and everything fears you. You are untouchable! You have 10 charges, one charge recharges in 10 seconds. Taking a hit nullifies the damage and loses one charge.\n\n\nI hope you enjoyed my huge high effort post. I couldve made probably 10mil by now but instead I typed this down. Like the post if you like the post, and dislike it if you dont. Bump it if you want others to see it."

Meaning, by sacrificing the use of a hoe with harvesting 5 (62.5% to double drops), you are replacing your tool with something that only gives a 25% double drop chance.\n\nEffectively, doesn't this make the Turbo-Cacti enchant useless?\n\nIf anyone knows a solution to this, where I can have turbo-cacti as well as harvesting on the same tool, please tell me"

    "title": "Comprehensive guide for Mages, All budgets, All catacombs levels - Open for suggestions",
    "body": "Hello skyblock players. Are you a mage? Do you want to be a mage? Are you LCM or RCM? Are you wondering whether you SHOULD go LCM or RCM? What does RCM or LCM mean? This guide includes everything you need to know about mages, how to play the class, how to play WITH the class and the terminologies used within our little mage community. Through testing I have found a few things that are really good but hidden under the eye lid of skyblock players, that can instantly boost ur mage experience. Let's get started!\n\nFirst of all, what is LCM or RCM? The term LCM means left-click mage, which is essentially where a player uses berserker talisman reforges, mage armor reforges and berserker weapons to use the mage beam and attack mobs. Many of the top players use this setup, which can be extremely powerful, and WAS the best mage setup before the addition of the midas staff. However, it is only good if 1. You are rich (300m - 700m), or 2. You are extremely high catacombs lvl (30 - 35). I don't recommend anyone to go LCM unless you are in one of those categories.\n\nWhat is RCM? RCM is right-click mage, or the mage that we all know. This type of mages are a lot more common in floors 1 -5 and you will most likely only see LCMs in Floor 6 in high-catacombs groups. This type of mages are really flexible in the gear that they can choose, as well as just being fun to play.\n\nGuide: What gear do I get?\nNow this part is difficult; because everyone has different budgets and different catacombs lvls. I'll be listing a few of the prototypes here, but if your situation is not on the list, ask it in the comment section and I'll help you, as well as adding your situation onto the guide.\nI will not be including budget / low catacombs lvl setups; Frozen scythe, zombie soldier / dark goggles or bonzo mask, sheep pet. Never go bonzo staff.\n\nCatacombs 16 - 20, budget of 20m - 30m\nFrozen scythe 5 starred.\nSuper heavy chestplate\nNecromancer lord leggings\nSpirit boots\nLegendary sheep pet lvl 70+\n\nCatacombs 21 - 24, budget of 31m - 50m\nSpirit sceptre\nFrozen scythe 5 starred\nSame armor as before, but with necromancer lord boots, and if you wish to do f6 use giant reforge on chestplate. Maybe use a mender fedora in boss fight.\n\nCatacombs 21 - 25, budget of 50m - 70m\n10 - 20 / 30m Midas staff, only use if you are catacombs 25 or above, OR if you are catacombs 24 and you'll probably get catacombs 25 soon.\n^ is surprisingly good, when dungeonised is about 2x better than 5 star yeti, for about the same cost and way lower catacombs level requirement.\nSame stuff as before, but use t9 / t10 chestplate and it's your choice if you wish to keep the frozen scythe or not. I didn't, but I recommend you to.\n\nCatacombs 26 - 29, budget of 70m - 110m\nSame weapons, but change 2/4 necromancer lord to wise dragon armor if you wish for more damage.\nYou may also switch to tierboosted enderdragon if you have the money.\nYeti sword is a waste of time quote @GamingDevil \n\nCatacombs 30 or above is where LCM because relevant. If you are still wishing to be RCM, use an 100m Midas staff.\nOtherwise,\nLivid dagger\n5 star Tarantula helmet with 3/4 shadow assassin\nLegendary ender dragon (TB or non TB doesn't really matter)\nLivid dagger (Giant's sword may work but I prefer livid)\nSpirit sceptre\nArmor on necrotic / loving, talismans on shaded, sword on fabled.\n\nNow, what do I need to be aware of when playing WITH a mage?\nMages tend to have quite the ego. The ego might help them if they know what they are doing, but if they don't, do not get in an argument with them. You will lose brain cells.\nAlso, Mages like to solo things. So take care of your baby mages. If they are good, let them run free. If they aren't, either be careful and help them, or\n/p leave, /warp dungeon_hub, /ignore add *mage*\n\n\nPlease leave suggestions! No hate towards anyone, only here to help.\nIF you leave a reaction, please comment why!"

    "title": "How You Can Get ENCHANTING 50 FAST",
    "body": "After 8-10 long and hard hours, I got enchanting 50. Now you might be thinking that 8-10 hours for enchanting 50 is extremely long, but actually, if you do the math, at 9 hours for 55.5m exp is ~6.2m per hour including breaks. This is because I used the surprisingly unpopular \"Skypixel\" mod that changes the enchanting table menu to the vanilla one (link: here *please note this is not my mod and all credit for this mod goes to the creator, prplz, lots of love to him*) Also, make sure you are obviously using level 95-100 epic/leg guardian, exp 4 potion WITH Viking tear, and exp boost 3 pot (basically a god potion, but not everyone uses those) + obviously a booster cookie. If you aren't going to 50, and even if you are, I'd highly recommend barrowing a pet, not buying, unless you get some absurdly low price. Also, a tip for people who struggle with double splashing, find a good dpi AND sensitivity. DPI affects IN menu and outside of menu moving, sensitivity is just outside moving. Also obviously use auto or large GUI scale.\nAnother quick thing while I'm at it, DO NOT, I AM SERIOUS, DO NOT GO FROM 0-50 IN 1 SITTING. It seriously hurts your hand and can cause LASTING HAND CRAMPS, I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE. If you have the materials, go from 0-35 to 43/44 THEN to 50, a lot easier.\nAnyway, go to the corner of the bookshelves and crouch a bit nearer to the crafting table, it helps you get closer and helps you double splash less. If you have bad ping, first of all you're screwed, and second of all make sure to time it correctly so you can anticipate when the enchantment table will open and close so you can make a rhythm that works for you. Also if enchanting frustrates you, I'd highly recommend doing it one hour at a time, personally helped me get used to it. Other than that, you should be good! Just have fun and maybe time yourself to see how fast you can get Arthritis...\n\n\nI mean clear out a stack of grands!"

    "body": "I usually play on blc because of its decent mods and pretty good fps. (Lunar gives less fps.) I only use forge for dungeons since it has very good mods, but little fps. But the more i play dungeons, the less fps i get. And after awhile, i run out of memory and then all textures turn white, then mc crashes. So I have 2 reasons why this is happening.\n\n1. Minecraft is taking up most of my gpu/cpu/memory\n\nI have used task manager to find this information.\nThese are the main apps i usually have.\n\n\n\n\nFrom this image, we can see that Minecraft (Java(TM) Platform SE Binary) has aa whopping 2900 megabytes (2.9 gigabytes), 25% of my cpu/gpu, and is taking up a very large amount of the power coming from my battery. The second most app that is taking the most of my computer is Chrome. Only taking up 180 megabytes, 2% of my cpu and 0% of my gpu. As well as taking up a very small amount of energy. Since Chrome is known for taking up a good amount of space, the next app is Discord. Taking up only 90 megabytes, 0% of cpu/gpu, and a small amount of power. I really dont know why this is happening but it really doesn't seem like MC is supposed to take up almost 3 gigs. This really doesn't have much evidence on its own, so were going to the next reason why this is happening. Mods\n\n2. Using a lot of mods may affect the fps.\nI use Refraction's mod folder v4 with some minor adjustments. Here are the mods I use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've heard about some mods affecting fps, but I don't know which ones. If you know, please tell me. People have also said that patcher makes a lot of difference, although for me it doesn't seem like it is. Tell me again how I can fix that.\n\nConclusion: I really don't know why this is happening. And I REALLY don't wanna play dungeons on blc. So any support would be great."

    "title": "My Idea- PvP Tourneys (Eliminates Pay-2-Win!)",
    "body": "For too long now has the Coliseum has been \"Disabled for renovations\". It is time we bring it back better than ever! Introducing...\n\nTHE WARRIOR'S GAUNTLET\n\n\"The Warrior's Gauntlet\" allows people to enjoy a PvP experience in Skyblock in a Balanced and Fair way. It is separated into 3 Leagues, being the Little League, Warrior's League, and Master's League. These Leagues all have their own rules and restrictions to balance out our favorite gameplay mechanics while also making PvP still a fun experience. I'll list the specifics here.\n\nThe Basics-\n\nWhen speaking to the Gladiator at Spawn, he will give you 2 options. The 1st will be \"Tourney\" while the 2nd will be \"Private Match\". Once selecting 1 of the 2 options, you will see 3 more. They will say \"Little League\", \"Warrior's League\", and \"Master's League\". Selecting one of these in the \"Tourney\" option will search for 7 more players with around the same leaderboard score as you in that specific League. Selecting one of these in the \"Private Match\" option will let you choose how many people are in a respected match, allowing you to create a tourney with the people in your party. Once in the match in any game mode, you will have 1 minute to choose 1 armor set that you have in your wardrobe to use for the match. You will NOT be able to interchange between armor sets. Once everyone is ready, a 5 minute timer will start and the battle will begin! May luck and skill be on your side!\n\nThe Leagues-\n\nThe different types of Leagues are very important towards the balancing of this PvP system. As I said before, each League has it's own restrictions and rules. I will go over them individually.\n\nLittle League\n\nPlayers can only use Common, Uncommon, and Rare Armor Sets and Weapons.\nEach Player's Fairy Souls are set to 0 and Talismans are disabled.\nZombie Swords and Power Orbs of ANY KIND are unusable.\nCritical Chance is set to 10%.\nEnderpearls, the Weird Tuba, and Grappling Hooks are unusable.\n\nThe Little League is meant to be for Beginners. We wouldn't want anyone with Lapis Armor up against someone in Superior, now would we? Now let's talk about the Warrior's League.\n\nWarrior's League\n\nPlayers can only use Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Epic Armor Sets and Weapons.\nEach Player's Fairy Souls are set to 100 and Talismans are disabled.\nThe Florid Zombie Sword, Mana Flux Power Orb, Overflux Power Orb, and Plasma Flux Power Orb are unusable.\nCritical Chance is set to 25%.\nEnderpearls and the Weird Tuba are unusable.\nThe Warrior's League is meant for Midgame Players. As you can see, restrictions have loosened quite a bit, but they aren't too bad. Onto the Master's League.\n\nMaster's League\n\nPlayer's can use any Rarity of Armor Sets and Weapons.\nEach Player's Fairy Souls are set to the MAX and Talismans are disabled (I do this because people might have more talismans than others, which provides an unfair advantage).\nNo Healing Items are unusable.\nCritical Chance is set to 50%.\nAll Items are usable.\nThe Master's League is meant for Endgame Players. Since they grinded so much for their gear, they should be allowed to use it.\n\nThe Leaderboards & Rewards-\n\nOf course, no good PvP game mode on Hypixel doesn't give rewards, so I set up some rewards for each and every League!\n\nStatic Rewards\n\nCoins |1k- Top 100,000|, |10k- Top 75,000|, |50k- Top 50,000|, |100k- Top 25,000|, |250k- Top 10,000|, |500k-Top 5,000|, |1m- Top 1,000|, |2.5m- 3rd Place|, |5m- 2nd Place|, |10m- 1st Place|\nBadge Talismans |Wooden (Common)- Top 100,000|, |Copper (Uncommon)- Top 50,000|, |Silver (Rare)- Top 25,000|, |Gold (Epic)- Top 10,000|, |Platinum (Legendary)- Top 5,000|\n\nLittle League Rewards\n\nNaive Shard (Rare) |1 Shard- Top 100,000|, |2 Shards- Top 75,000|, |3 Shards- Top 50,000|\nNaive Warrior's Blade (Rare) |+100 Atk, +80 Strength, +50 Critical Damage, 150 Intelligence, Ability: Beginner's Promise (For 3 seconds, your hits will deal 25% more Damage.

You see, Skyblock's economy is different from the real life market. To put this simply, let's go back to the beginning of skyblock when the ember rods dwelled in hands of the rich. At that time, how much did the ember rod cost? Well, it cost few hundred thousand coins. Now, back to the present. If we look at Ah, the most expensive weapon, such as the midas sword, livid dagger and the daedalus axe costs FEW HUNDRED MILLION coins. So, what happened? well during the 1 year and half of skyblock, the economy had too much coins. Players can make millions of coins easily and that is the key problem. You see, if the economy has too much money, the value of money will drop. This is called an inflation. Currently, skyblock is at an all time high inflation and what matters more is that ITS GOING TO GET EVEN WORSE as players make more and more money. So, here is what i propose. We need to increase the value of coins. Whether that is by making money making harder or just decrease the amount of money in market."

    "body": "Okay, over the past days I have had some ideas to add to skyblock and I want to share them with you all!\n\nUltimate Enchants:\n1. Unbreakable (Craftable):\nUnbreakable could be an Ultimate that reduces durability damage a dungeon item takes. It would go up to 5 levels like every other Ultimate. Yes, it should be craftable. It would be 32 enchanted obsidian around 64 enchanted paper, however this gives you the 2nd level of the item. It would be the last collection in the obsidian collection. The Unbreakable 1-5 enchants should also be found in dungeons 1-6. F1 could give Unbreakable 1, F2 could give Unbreakable 1-2, F3 could give Unbreakable 2-3, F4 could give Unbreakable 3-4, and etc. \n\n2. Length (Not Craftable)\nLength would be an Ultimate that adds slight reach to an item. Each Length level adds .5 blocks of reach. This also goes to level 5. You can find them in floors 3-6. F3 is Length 1, F4 is Length 2, F5 is Length 3-4, F6 is Length 4-5.\n\nItems:\nSo, we can all agree that the nether rack collection is lacking, right? Well, this idea adds 5 brand new items. The first is enchanted nether rack which is unlocked at 1.5k collection. This is worthless, but is used to craft the next item, enchanted nether bricks(5k collection). Again useless, but is used to make enchanted nether brick blocks(10k collection). This item IS useful as it crafts the frying pan (20k collection). I am not sure the stats of this weapon, but I know that it should have a variant at 100k collection called burning frying pan.\n\nTell me what you think! (also what should the frying pan do?)"

But I spent hours and made my friend do it too, foraging combat mining minions talismans. It was stressful, the days literally felt shorter, it would get really hot and I didn\u2019t even feel excitement when logging on, then my friend got tired and slowly drifted to other games, when alpha was released he was gone, but I wanted to progress and show him that we could still have fun, but he stopped responding to me. I think he got sick of seeing my texts, and I didn\u2019t even feel my arms anymore I would play 12 hours a day non stop, it hurt to get out of that position I would play in, so I decided to take a break focus on school but after 30 mins away from skyblock it just got really hot and I couldn\u2019t even think properly, I\u2019m not kidding I literally had to buy an extra fan to cool me down, as soon as I got back on skyblock I immediately started thinking of prices of items and how much of each slayer you should do during what time of day I thought of how many resources a coal minion could make in a month and I started to play vanilla and I froze for 5 mins trying to find out where the stupid menu was, and I also sit with my legs folded on top of my desk with my back grinding against my chair like this -> (\nSo my legs hurt like **** PLEASE HELP ME.

    "body": "The General Idea of\nAURAS\nAuras are like pets but give you extra dungeon abilities, or extra stat boosts in general, they also come with cool particle effects!\nAura types can vary between the drops from many different types of mobs and skill types.\nAura Types;\nFarming Auras\nForaging Auras\nAlchemy Auras\nDungeon Auras\nCombat Auras\nMining Auras\n& MORE SOON\n\n*DISCLAIMER*\n-NONE OF THE AURA ABILITIES ARE FINAL-\n\u200b Where Do I Access my Auras?\nAuras should be located just below collections and to \nthe pet menu's left side.\n\nfrom there, you can choose your varieties of auras!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Does the GUI Look Like?\nSimilar to the pets menu, The Aura menu has different\nsettings on how you want your auras displayed, and\neventually after this thread is finished, ill work on a \nsetting where ranked players can change the way\nthe particles behave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre There Any Settings?\nYes,\nyou can choose from making your\naura particles visible or invisible here;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Aura Drop Chances\nCommon : 1.5%\nUncommon : 0.5%\nRare : 0.2%\nEpic : 0.12%\nLegendary : 0.09%\nMythic : 0.01%\nim ****ty at math so i just made these numbers up\n\n\n\n\n Where To Get Auras\nAuras can be obtained in many ways, the easiest\nway is obtaining them from a new npc, Aurora\n\n\n\n\n(feel free to simp if you'd like)\nAn example of her GUI would look a little like this;\n\n\n\nMost Auras will be craftable.\ni.e the foraging, some alchemy, mining, combat, and farming auras will be crafted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I Craft Auras?\nThere are 2 ways to craft auras,\ncraft with a normal Aura Crystal\n\n\n\n\nEnchanted Diamonds 128x\nCrystal Fragments 192x\nEnchanted Quartz Block 12x\n\nor use a Weaker Aura Crystal\n\n\n\n\nEnchanted Diamonds 64x\nCrystal Fragments 96x\nEnchanted Quartz Block 6x\n\n\n\n\n Examples of Auras\nalthough this idea is in ways, similar to pets, it adds a cosmetic\naspect to it, different of how pets are. Of course, ranked players\nwill not be able to have exclusive access to auras at all.\n\nhopefully the only thing that should be exclusive to ranked\nplayers is the way the particles behave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i.e having the particles in a swirl pattern or static pattern)\n\n*NOT FINAL*\n\n\n\nmore aura examples coming soon if theres positive feedback.\n\n\n\nI would appreciate it greatly if you dropped a \"creative\" rating if you enjoyed or hope to see this implemented."

Well I think a good idea to encourage people to install this so called app in order to get a reminder before a certain event starts or you can choose a certain event on a certain skyblock day. Also you can add different features for the app as well including your skyblock profile featuring skills, minions, collections, etc. similar to sky.lea or sky.shiyu, also you can add a news tab for game updates, announcements, bug fix's, etc. and you also have the idea that started this forum, the event calendar. It'll first show the current skyblock month along with the current day and what events are occurring. EX: Early August 12th, Spooky Event in 1h 24m, Season Of Jerry in 12h 5m) you also have an option to set a reminder for that certain event. You can also see the other days and what events are occurring then. I think implementing this app will help encourage people to play and also give them a spark of joy by getting that thought you could've missed it without the reminder, thank you for your time."

Well, there's a ultimate enchant you can put on swords, but not rods, that increases your sea creature chance with the right pet - the chimera enchantment. With a max level dolphin, granting +5 scc, and a washed up souvenir, adding +5 scc to the pet, a Shredder with Chimera 5 grants +10 scc. That's 3 more than ROTS.\nOf course, you're paying like 100 million for +3% chance to get a rare sea creature. But you are playing Hypixel Skyblock, so..."

    "title": "Limit the daily available playtime in The Dragon's Nest (Read before you scream.)",
    "body": "The Dragon\u2019s Nest is a land void of happiness. It is full of despair, anger, sadness, addiction, and hopelessness. Every day, people waste hours upon hours of their lives sweating the dragon\u2019s nest, desperately seeking anything that can get them further ahead in the game, even if it means hurting other people in the process.\n\nI think something seriously needs to happen to the dragon\u2019s nest in terms of allowed playtime in it. There\u2019s no way that it can keep going on the way it is without there being serious consequences to kids in real life. This addiction that most have to grinding Zealots in the Dragon\u2019s Nest is affecting their lives in really bad ways. Lots of them purposefully miss online classes just to partake in it. Increasing anger over stolen kills, slowly developing depression from the absolute nothing that it brings to someone\u2019s emotional and mental health state, etc.\n\nMy proposal is to introduce a time limit per day for players when it comes to the Dragon\u2019s Nest. This is the only way that I can see any of this being fixed. Make no mistake, I\u2019m extremely aware of how unpopular this is gonna be to a lot of people. I realize that I will likely be called very bad names by several people for me even thinking to suggest this, but I think it\u2019s crucial that it be brought up.\n\n2 different 3 hour spans a day, the Dragon\u2019s Nest would be open to all players, 3 hours in the morning, and 3 hours in the evening/night time, to hopefully cater to multiple time zones across the world, and to also allow most kids to be able to play without interrupting their online classes, or in person classes.\n\nI think by introducing this limited playtime, it would turn into sort of a Grinch Simulator effect, where people can actually have fun in the Dragon\u2019s Nest, knowing that they only get a limited amount in it per day. I think the hostile atmosphere will be dramatically less, as you won\u2019t get anyone who\u2019s been in there the past 15 hours no sleep, and I think that it will shine the spotlight on more areas of Skyblock that most players probably might not be familiar with, like Dungeons and Farming and Revenants, etc.\n\nNow, keep in mind, this would apply to the Dragon\u2019s Nest ONLY. The End Island as a whole will still be open at all times. That means you don\u2019t have to worry about not being able to grind pets, combat levels, etc. Just the Dragon\u2019s Nest, and more specifically, the Eyes.\n\nNow, on top of this, these are the changes I propose happen to the Dragon\u2019s Nest as a whole to hopefully counter some of the unavoidable changes that would happen with this being added.\n\n1: Make Zealots spawn more frequently and often. \n-By increasing zealot rates drastically during the time the nest would be open, that will hopefully make eyes easier to get during the limited time, and hopefully counter out any economic change that would be brought forward by the nest being closed for most of the day.\n\n2: Minimum player number of 10-15 per lobby.\n-This one might be harder from a technical side, since this would mean more servers would be needed, but I think it could potentially be done.\n\n3: Damage Cap on Dragons.\n-This one simply has to happen. It\u2019s unacceptable that players can do 16 million damage to dragons in 10 seconds. Have a 5 million damage cap, and everyone that reaches it has the same chance at winning some cool items. Make it more encouraging and welcoming for everyone.\n\n\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts, reactions, and concerns. I\u2019ll try to respond to as many as I can.\n\n\nEDIT: RESPONDING TO FREQUENTLY BROUGHT UP POINTS\n\nSo it\u2019s been a hot minute since I posted this thread. A lot of responses have come in, and I wanted to say how pleasantly surprised I was at the reception to this thread. I was prepared for so many more dislikes, hate posts, attacking posts, etc.\n\nNot only have there been a lot of supportive responses, but even the disagreement responses have been, for the most part, non aggressive, and actually explaining their reasoning for why they don\u2019t like it, and I\u2019m really grateful that we can have this discussion without any of that toxicity coming between us. I\u2019ve seen some meme responses, non helpful responses, and attacks still, but that number is so far less what I thought it was gonna be.\n\nNow, I want to try to respond to some of the majorly favorite points people are beginning up as best as I can. Keep in mind that I do not play this game for progression reasons. I play it for fun and enjoyment, and that may affect the way I see things, which may convince you guys to see me as \u201cdumb\u201d or \u201can idiot\u201d or \u201cout of your mind.\u201d and that\u2019s ok, as long as you\u2019re respectful about it.\n\n\n*People will sweat way more knowing they have a limited amount of time to grind in the End.\n\n-This is what I hope the more frequent zealot spawns and the lesser number of players on islands will help to counter. I think the thing now is that there are too few zealots and too many players per island. If we tweak those things, it shouldn\u2019t really change much if some people are a little more sweaty, cause the more frequent zealot spawns and less players should evenly balance that out.\n\n\n*Kids will have to specifically play at a certain time, meaning they actually will miss things and it will have the opposite effect.\n\nNot really, at least I don\u2019t think. Cause with those 6 hours that you\u2019d have in Dragon\u2019s Nest, that still leaves you with 18 hours left in the day, Let\u2019s assume you sleep about 8 hours a day, that\u2019s still 10 hours that you have to work on other things in real life that you can do worry free. If you need to schedule your day around the dragon\u2019s nest being open at a specific time, and you\u2019re using your other time to do school work and hang out with your family and such, I think that ends up working out much better for you then simply being online the entire day in the dragon nest.\n\nRegarding \u201cKids will still miss their classes\u201d I tried to pick the times that are most likely to occur when most kids are not in a class. My specific times that I don\u2019t think I mentioned in the thread were 4-7 PM EST and 4-7 AM EST, before most school starts, and after most school ends. Of course, there\u2019s never gonna be a perfect timespan where every single kid doesn\u2019t have class and is free for 3 hours straight, so I always knew this was gonna be a hard one to find a perfect thing for. I think those times I picked will be the best.\n\n\n*Hypixel should not be the ones to limit playtime, it should be their parents.\n\n-Unfortunately, we\u2019re in a time where parents aren\u2019t really doing such a great job. If it were the case, then I definitely wouldn\u2019t have to suggest it, but here we are. People are right when they say it is not Hypixel\u2019s responsibility to keep track of how long kids are playing online, but I think the server can set a good example for other online communities, and maybe even win more parent support for doing it.\n\n\nI think those are the big 3. I\u2019ll keep reading to find more."

    "body": "Ok so there\u2019s this cool game called castle crashers, and it has some cool stuff that could be added to hypixel skyblock.\n\nnew magic spells that doesn\u2019t need a sword to use, just you.\n\nyou can click on the menu, and choose a carachter for the rest of your game. If new profile then it will bring it up first thing.\n\nIce: ice type character, magic attack will be ice throw in in front of you which deals damage and freezes enemies for X seconds (scales up)\nFire: fire in front of you, will burn mobs over time and immediate damage will be X ( scales up) \nred guy (idk man): electricity type carachter, will stun mobs and deal damage, but stunned mobs can still damage you.\nThis uses up mana. \nNow how does damage scales up? New skill called magic:\nGain magic xp for damage you deal with magic.\nAs it scales up it gives you more ability damage, which also affects your magic (not just weapon abilities)\nAlso as it scales up your damage dealt with magic. (Only magic, not weapon abilit(Ability damage is a real thing in skyblock ok)\n\n\nAs you get morelevels, you can use more spells. To use your spell it can be like M or something, and then other spells could be M and Space.\n\nOk add it thanks \n\nnot sure if this has already been suggested"

    "title": "Skyblock in D&D(1)",
    "body": "Hi everyone, SnowMinionT11 here, and I've decided to make Dungeons and Dragons items for skyblock, corresponding as best as I can. Let's start.\nSuperior Dragon Armor is going to be based off of Mithral Scale Mail. This mimics a dragons scales. Ordinarily, this would hinder movement, but Superior doesn't do that in game, so we're using mithral. Mithral armor removes the movement and dexterity penalties for wearing heavy or medium armor. We're going to give it a buff to AC as well, and bonus on ability checks for the set bonus.\nSo our final stats are:\nSuperior Dragon Armor: Legendary Armor\nAC 17\n+2 to ability checks.\nAll around, good, and viable for every class! \nVoodoo Doll:\nInterestingly, voodoo dolls already exist in DND as random trinkets. Let's try something else.\n\nAs a bonus action, you may trigger this doll while it is in your hand. If you do, pick an enemy up to 120 feet away that you can see. That target must make a DC 18 dexterity save. On a hit, 8 magical arrows appear around the target. Each arrow deals 1d8 damage initially and deals 8d4 force damage per round for 5 rounds. On a miss, the target must make a DC 10 wisdom save or become frightened for 1 round. This doll has 15 charges that reset after you take a long rest.\n\nPretty nasty overall. The fear is because, well, magic arrows materializing around you trying to impale you is happening.\n\nSilent Death:\nThis seems like something good for rogues, so I'll heavily nerf this to prevent a complete massacre.\n\nSilent Death:Rare Shortsword\nPrerequisites: Assasin Rogue Subclass\nAs a move action, you may disappear into the Shadowfell. The next round, you appear behind your opponent in an empty space, or if there is no empty space, the target is pushed. Using this ability grants combat advantage, and allows you to add 1d8 to your next attack on any attacks this round. If the target is pushed, you do not get combat advantage.\n\nWhat do you guys want to see?"

If you know anything about what happened, keep it to yourself, no matter how important you think it is. Both of us are sick of this fighting, and we've worked out a compromise that we're both fine with. All I ask from the rest of you is to not send hate towards either of us for any reason. Toxicity over this kind of stuff tends to get out of hand quickly if not put to a halt, and death threats of any kind over a block game are a bit much.\n\nWe both know our errors, and my only wish is for this to be resolved peacefully.\n\nI hope you all understand,\n- Hypernova642"

    "title": "Suggested Endermite Pet Rework",
    "body": "Endermite Pet is pretty useless now.\n\nHere are its current stats at level 100 (screen shot from the wiki):\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the first perk is useless:\n1. No one mines end stone unless it is during the mining event.\n2. If they do mine during the mining event they would be using a silverfish pet for more mining xp as the mining event doubles mining xp on public islands.\n\nWhy the second perk is useless:\n1. Sacks are cheaper than crafting this pet.\n2. Sacks do not have to be leveled up, so selling ender pearls from a sack will make as much money per ender pearl as a decently leveled endermite pet.\n3. Everyone else uses Sacks, so you cannot pick up ender pearls on the ground very often (this makes the second change this pet got a hard nerf).\n\nWhy the third perk is useless:\n1. Everyone grinding zealots is likely already using a God Potion and has hit Max Speed already.\n\n\n\nMy suggestions for a rework:\n(These are probably not very balanced but I tried)\n(Level 100 Legendary)\n\nBase Stats:\n+100 intelligence (+1 per level)\n+20 speed (+1 every 5 levels/+0.2 per level)\n\nWhy extra speed - Endermites are small and why not.\n\n1st perk:\n\nEndermite Friend: You can no longer attack endermites, and they will not target you. (Does not upgrade per level)\n\nWhy this perk - Endermites are annoying to hit.\n\n2nd perk:\n\nPearl Finder: Gain +50% chance (+1% chance every 2 levels/+0.5% chance per level) to get 100% more pearls (2x) when you kill an enderman or zealot.\n\nWhy this perk - keeps the original intention of the pet, which is to get more money from endermen/zealots while you are grinding. The difference is that this perk works with a sack while the current perk works against a sack. (This perk may need a nerf).\n\n3rd perk:\n\nZealot Hunter: Gain 10% more damage to zealots (+1% every 10 levels/+0.1% per level). After killing a zealot, gain 25 speed (+1 every 4 levels/+0.25 per level)(increases speed cap by amount given), 10 strength (+1 every 10 levels/+0.1 per level), 20 intelligence(+1 every 5 levels/+0.2 per level), and jump boost 4 for 20 seconds.\n\nWhy this perk - This pet can be useful for helping newer players kill zealots, or older players who don't want to use a god potion. (This perk may need a nerf).\n\n\n\nI feel these perks would buff the endermite pet to be more useful in the current state of the game.\n\n\nAdditional idea: Pet item to make endermite pet mythic rarity\n\nShiny Green Orb\n\nPossible Drops (ideas):\n\n1. RNG drop from Special Zealots (like 1/250 or something)\n\n2.Drop from Old Dragons.\n\nAdds 4th perk:\n\nPrecious Pearls:\n\nIncrease Pearl Finder pearl chance to 100% and increase the amount of pearls to 200% more pearls.\nUpon getting an Enchanted Ender Pearl as a rare drop, you will gain an additional 20 coins. For an Enchanted Eye of Ender, you will gain an additional 350 coins. (This does not consume the Enchanted Ender Pearl or Enchanted Eye of Ender).\n\n\n\nThis probably isn't balanced, but this pet was so useful and good on release, then they nerfed him twice, and added new stuff that made him more useless and I want it to be useful again.\n\nIf you have any suggestions let me know."

There are many better things to do with your life. To those who grind Skyblock a huge amount, I want to say something to you specifically: spend a day without Skyblock. Spend time with your friends and family. Maybe do some writing or drawing and bring out your creative side. Maybe even get a boyfriend/girlfriend to spend time with. ANnything to help you not waste so much time on Skyblock.\nThank you for reading this."

Those 20 sell for approximately 100-120k coins. Then you get a Green gift. Which is worth around 10K Coins. That's an easy 1-130k+ Coins from less than 10 minutes of work! (and you have fun while making money!) You can also use the gifts to try and get a Snow Minion!\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nChicken Race *NOTE* You can only do this once!\nDuring the event, there is a big hill, not the volcano, it's the one behind the bank. Go on top of it and towards one of the sides you should see Gulliver The Chicken. Do the chicken race and you will get a Gift Compass (Worth 20-50K Coins!, a Red Gift (Worth 40k+ COINS!), and a Frozen Chicken Talisman.\nThat is an Easy 80K+ (if you sell the gift compass which I don't recommend, you should keep it to find the gifts.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nSnow Minions\nFor this one, you will either need a snow minion or 5-700k+ Coins, This is more for people with more coins. \nStep One: Buy a Snow Minion (Preferably Tier 1.)\nStep Two: Buy 16 Stacks of Snow Blocks and 4 Stacks of Enchanted Snow Blocks.

I never do this one but I know you can catch Frosty, (Gives gifts),\nThe Grinch (gives gifts) and other fishing stuff. This is a biased opinion because I do not like fishing but you can for sure make a profit with it,\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThe Actual Event\nThis is probably, one of the best methods out of all. There is 4-5 Rounds, Each round Magma Cubes, and magma troops spawn, focus on the magma cubes. If you do enough damage, you get a lot of gifts, (7-10 White 7-10 Green 1-2 Red) Most of the time. Therefore, after 4-5 Rounds you will have 8-10 Red gifts, Which sell for 40k+ each, 30-40 Green gifts, Which sell for 10k+ each, and 30-40 white gifts, which sell for 5k+ each.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMy Conclusion is, There are many methods, and if you can try to do all of these, There are more that I did not list, but these are the easiest ones, in my opinion, feel free to share your money-making methods! And if this helped you, Please recommend more events for me to cover!\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n-Ehxo"

    "body": "I've made a video, but I'll write out the armor if you don't wanna watch it\n\n\n\n\nSo, this armor is quite cheap, but I still see people running around in strong with farmers boots or other armors in farmers boots. But with this armor it gives you 100 extra speed and no extra chromosomes. The main parts of the armor is a young helmet, obsidian chestplate (Full inventory of obsidian but 3 slots, 1 for sword, 1 for backpack, and one for being able to pick up summoning eye.) young dragon pants, and farmer boots (Level 19 or 20 farming recommended for best speed.) This will give you a constant of about 340% Speed, and will allow you to zoom past the other people. \n\nAnyway, if your super rich, and just do dragons, and don't need to know this, hope you have a good rest of forum scrolling <3"

Grasslands and plains greener than imaginable. The lush scenery of plants filled the world.\n\nEverywhere you looked, you could see beautiful colors everywhere. But, everything changed when the admins arrived.\n\n\u201cHey, Zeal!\u201d I called out to my friend. \u201cWhere ya heading?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot anywhere, in particular, just going to explore New Plain City,\u201d he said.\n\nI am known as Humphrey the Enderman. I live in the wonderful town of Plain City. Well, it\u2019s not a city. Plain City is the oldest and most sacred village throughout the world. It is ancient to the point where it was built even before my Grandpa Ernest was born! Recently, my dad and his construction workers have been building another city that is named: \u201cNew Plain City\u201d, in honor of Plain City.\n\nI lived under the same roof with Zeal, my childhood friend! His parents were kidnapped when he was born so my parents took him under their wing and adopted him. Although Zeal is shorter than me, he is way older and weaker. Compared to him, it makes me realize how short I am for my age...\n\nWell, for today, Zeal told me that he is going to find a job in New Plain City. I don\u2019t know if he will be able to find one because all the jobs are construction jobs. Mainly for the strong endermen.\n\n\u201cYou want me to come along? After all, it\u2019s your first job!\u201d\n\n\u201cYea sure, you can follow me,\u201d said Zeal.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Chapter 2 - Expansion\n\n\n\n\u201cAre we ready to begin Operation 45 6e 64 65 72 6d 61 6e?\u201d a voice said.\n\n\u201cBrother, I told you, we cannot rush the operation, because one small minuscule detail will render the portal useless...\u201d said another voice\n\n\u201cGrrr, just hurry up, we don\u2019t have all day.\u201d said the first voice impatiently.\n\n\u201cOkay! Okay! I\u2019m trying to get everything in commission as fast as possible so just shut your rainbow-colored mouth and keep still!\u201d\n\nBOOOOM!!\n\n\u201cIt worked! IT WORKED!!\u201d cried the first voice.\n\n\u201cGo go go! Just step inside the glowing ring and the portal will take us wherever we want to go.\u201d yelled the second voice.\n\n\u201cEhehehe\u2026 AHAHAHA! Operation 45 6e 64 65 72 6d 61 6e is now a success! \u201d\n\u201cHQ did you copy? I repeat, Operation 45 6e 64 65 72 6d 61 6e is a success!\u201d\n\nA whisper could be heard from the radio\u2026\n\n\u201cYes... We did. Hmmm? You said reports of strange purple insects?\u201d\n\n\u201cAhaha! Sanitize the insects! Sanitize it!\u201d the 2nd voice cackled.\n\nThis day was known as: \u201cThe Infiltration of The Portal\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, and there\u2019s more?\u201d questioned the 3rd voice.\n\nThe radio now could be heard announcing to the team:\n\u201cNext objective: Project Coloniam Deductam\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Chapter 3 - The Abduction\n\n\n\nAs I walked with Zeal to New Plain City, a sense of dread fell upon me.\nAll of my dad\u2019s workers were gone. The noisy work in progress city was dead silent.\n\n\u201cSomething weird is happening,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d mumbled Zeal as he kept on walking towards the city.\n\n\u201cThere are no workers here and I get the feeling someone is watching us.\u201d\n\nI turned around and took a look at my surroundings. Even without workers, New Plain City was an ultramodern city with functions I could only dream existed. Their underground tunnels connected every building, with houses twice the size of mine, and even floating gardens. New Plain City would become the greatest city that ever existed and would serve as a huge marketplace and entertainment area.\n\nWhile I was busy daydreaming, Zeal decided to head another way.\n\n\u201cHumphrey! Humphrey! Are you even listening? I\u2019m gonna go explore and see what places I can work at!\u201d snapped Zeal.\n\nI was fine with this as it meant I could investigate more on a mysterious phenomenon that I felt not too long ago. I headed over to what seemed like a park when suddenly, I heard a cry.\n\n\u201cHelp! Somebody help! I\u2019m getti--\u201d and then the voice was silent.\n\nI ran over to where the voice was and saw two strange men in black suits and masks. One was holding a hand over Zeal\u2019s mouth and the other was grabbing his hands and tying them behind his back.\n\n\u201cHey! Let go of my friend! You\u2019ve made a big mistake coming here!\u201d I yelled.\n\nThe two men looked at each other then nodded their heads in agreement and escaped. Haphazardly, the shorter man tripped over a wood bar and dropped to the floor. I took this opportunity and dove at him, ripping his mask and suit off.\n\nOne of the men punched me in the face knocking me to the ground. I groaned.\n\n\u201cZeal?\u201d\n\nI saw out of the corner of my eye that the two men had taken Zeal and were running away. Although I didn\u2019t know it at the time, that would be the last time I would see Zeal.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Chapter 4 - Lockdown\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s WHAT?\u201d said my panicking father.\n\u201cWe need to find these men right away! I will talk to the town elder and we will see what to do about this.\u201d\n\nI had just explained to my parents what happened to Zeal and the two men. My father was confident we could find the two men while my mother wept in her chair.\n\n\u201cH-h-he\u2019s gone?\u201d stammered my mother, not being able to handle the situation.\n\u201cHe was like a brother to you, not to mention your best friend. As your father said, we definitely must speak with the town Elder.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d I said volunteering.\n\n\u201cNo no, you must stay home and protect the village,\u201d replied my father.\n\n\u201cI was there when it happened so I need to be there with you to explain it!\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, we shall take you with us to the Elder.\u201d said my mother, wiping a tear from her eye.\n\nWe stepped out of our house and walked across to the other side of town to the Elder\u2019s house.\n\n*Knock knock knock*\n\n*A door could be heard being opened.*\n\n\u201cI know what happened last night.\u201d the Elder stated.\n\n\u201cBut, how? You weren\u2019t there,\u201d I said, confusingly.\n\n\u201cI know a lot and I see a lot, which is why I am the Town Elder,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Elder then asked me to leave and spoke with my parents privately.\n\nAfter waiting a while, my parents came out of the building. They told me that the Elder had started a lockdown and curfew. From now on, we would have to stay inside the house for 1 hour after dusk. We could also only go outside if it was an emergency. Guards were surrounding the vicinity of the residency to establish security.\n\nI grumbled at the news of this but I knew it was for the best.\n\nAt dusk, I went inside the house and sat down reminiscing about the series of events that led up to this moment. If only I had stayed with Zeal moments before he was kidnapped...\n\n*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK!*\n\nThere was a series of knocks at the door.\n\nI was confused because there should\u2019ve been guards out there. I slowly opened the door and right when I could see through the gap between the door, two sets of hands grabbed me and pulled me outside. It was the two men. I cried out in pain as they twisted my arm.\n\nThe man with the visor covered my mouth, preventing any sound from escaping. The last thing I saw before passing out was the guard in front of our house, with his shattered helmet and his limp body.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Chapter 5 - Camp\n\n\n\nI woke up in a dark room with my legs and arms bound. My vision was hazy.\n\nWhere am I? I thought.\n\nThen I recalled what had happened.\n\nI was dragged away by 2 people in white suits. Zeal was taken on the same day. All the construction workers were gone. There was a lockdown. All these thoughts rushed to my head, as a person came approaching me.\n\n\u201cLet me go! Where\u2019s Zeal?!\u201d I demanded.\n\n\u201cZeal... Hmmm, isn\u2019t that the guy that we took at the construction site?\u201d he said, turning around.\n\n\u201cApparently...\u201d replied the man with the visor and white suit.\n\nThe men walked around and inspected me.\nThey poked at my small arms with a stick. I flinched every time they got near my neck.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just like the other one,\u201d the second man stated.\n\nThey unbound my arms and pinned them behind my back. Then with a *click*, they locked my hands together with strange black material. They forced me to walk into a room with bars surrounding it. After locking me in, they strolled away.\n\nThey started speaking and I pressed my ear against the wall. I made out only a few words.\n\n\u201cinvade\u2026.population...Plain\u201d\n\nI stopped at that. Population, invasion, Plain, then something in my head clicked. They were going to invade Plain City! Oh no, this was bad. Really Bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Chapter 6 - The Invasion\n\n\n\nI peeked out of my cell and saw hundreds of soldiers marching outside the window.\nMany of them seemed to wield diamond hoes. They also wore diamond chest plates and boots. Every step sounded like a thousand explosions and my ears were ringing.\n\n\u201cSurrender now or face our wrath, we will not hold back!\u201d they chanted, \u201cSurrender now or face our wrath, we will not hold back!\u201d\n\nIt was almost like they were made to only say that. After a while, my ears blocked out the chants. If this army was going to invade Plain City, the guards there stood no chance.\n\nI knew that something must be done.\nWhat was the point of staying in my cell and wasting my time?\n\nWait, they haven\u2019t emptied my pockets.\nI remembered that I brought my pencil for note-taking like usual.\nIt seems like there is a lock as well, securing the door to my cell!\n\nWithout any hesitation, I attempted to pick the lock, with little hopes of unlocking it.\n\nClick!\n\nI never imagined that a pencil would be successful in unlocking a lock.\n\nThe security alarms rang.\n\u201cStop right there, prisoner!\u201d\n\nI paid them no attention as the last of the soldiers advanced through the building and into the plains.\n\n\u201cI have to run...\u201d I thought to myself\u2026\n\nI must warn Plain City... \nI must make haste\u2026\n\nHowever, as I ran through the prison, I noticed some strange incubators.\n\nThere was a sign that read: \u201dProject 45 6e 64 65 72 6d 61 6e\u201d\n\nAmong the tanks, a person just like me was incubated\u2026\n\nI shuddered at the thought of me becoming like the person\u2026\n\nI tried to hide as a phone in a nearby room rang.\n\n\u201cYes? I see. We shall begin the operation. Prepare the Mass Transit System now.\u201d\n\nHave they already arrived at Plain City?\nHow do they even cover such a long distance in a short period?\n\nHeavy footsteps resounded out of the room.\nThe person in a white suit with a helmet walked out the room and towards the exit, carrying a radio...\n\nI heard him cackling while answering the radio saying:\n\u201cAhahaha! Start the Mass Transit System.\u201d\n\nI watched in horror as the sky turned purple.\n\nHe noticed me and with an evil laugh said:\n\u201cYou see boy, you can\u2019t prevent this. After all, it's for the sake of our race and improving the sanitary conditions of our brethren.\u201d\n\nAs he concluded his sentence, a deep tremoring sound echoed through the air.\n\nAnd with a zap, the whole city disappeared.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Chapter 7 - Operation 45 6e 64 65 72 6d 61 6e\n\n\n\nAfter Plain City disappeared, I was traumatized. What happened to everyone and everything inside of it? Were they dead? What about my parents? And the town Elder! I collapsed to the ground in a sob.\n\n\u201cNow let\u2019s get you back to your cell,\u201d said the man as he grabbed me by my arm and dragged me back to my cell, \u201cand this time we\u2019ll search you.\u201d\n\nThis time, I didn\u2019t fight back. I couldn\u2019t, I felt paralyzed. After seeing my home get erased from existence, I had no energy. I only felt sadness and grief.\n\nThey locked me into my cell again but this time, they took all my belongings and burned them. They also put a guard in front of my cell to make sure I didn\u2019t escape.\n\nAfter the second day, I lost track of time and everything began to blend. My sight became fuzzy and I became light-headed.\n\nThen, the guard said something that surprised me.\n\n\u201cThe master wishes to talk to you,\u201d he said in a scraggly voice.\n\nHe walked into my cell and tied my hands together again with the black material and walked me into a room with all black walls. There was a very grand dark oak table and at the very end sat a man wearing the white suit and helmet.\n\n\u201cTell me, have you heard about Operation 45 6e 64 65 72 6d 61 6e?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cUhhh, no what\u2019s that?\u201d I lied.\n\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019m that stupid? I can tell when you\u2019re lying,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnyway, Operation 45 6e 64 65 72 61 6e is about rebuilding that wretched town, the one you guys call Plain City, and reconstructing the species of endermen!\u201d he said, an evil smile across his face.\n\n\u201cYou see, we\u2019ve already started the process and there's nothing you can do to stop it!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen those incubator tanks, you\u2019ve seen the endermen floating inside of them. Those hideous excuses for endermen are going to be changed, transformed into a bigger, stronger, and more powerful species,\u201d he said.\n\nHe walked over to the other side of the table where I sat, grabbed my neck, and dragged me with him. I could barely breathe. He brought me to a room with a bunch of strange redstone devices and looked me in the eye.\n\n\u201cYou see this? This is how we are going to change your species, your pathetic species will be reborn, rebuilt, and remade into the strongest beings the world has ever seen!\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother!\u201d another voice called from across the hallway, \u201cWhere are you? Oh there you are, I see you are giving our \u201cguest\u201d a tour.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuiet fool, leave me alone,\u201d the man with the helmet said.\n\n\u201cWhere are my parents, where is my family, WHERE IS THE REST OF PLAIN CITY?\u201d I shouted.\n\n\u201cI knew you were going to say that,\u201d he said, \u201cCome, follow me.\u201d\n\nHe brought me down a flight of stairs and led me into a dark hallway. There were dozens if not hundreds of rooms, each of them with an iron door and a guard guarding them. In each cell was someone from Plain City. I saw them stare at me with tears, begging for me to rescue them but we all knew there was nothing I could do.\n\nMy hands were still bound behind my back and even if they weren\u2019t, the guards outnumbered me 50 to 1. The man then led me back up the stairs into the room with the incubation chambers.\n\n\u201cOnce these endermen come in contact with oxygen, they will begin the evolution process and become enhanced endermen!\u201d he said with a cackle.\n\nThen, he opened one of the tanks full of green liquid. Surprisingly, the liquid didn\u2019t flow out like other liquids. The enderman inside of the tank stumbled out with a dazed look.\n\n\u201cWhere am-,\u201d he paused and fell.\n\n\u201cIs he okay?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s fine, my state of the art scientists perfected the formula a thousand times!\u201d he boasted.\n\nThen, the enderman stood up straight and his limbs began to grow. His arms doubled and his height tripled. He seems a lot bulkier than before.\n\nThe former enderman kneeled and said in a monotone voice, \u201cIt is my pleasure to serve you, O Great One.\u201d\n\n\u201cRise,\u201d said the man in the white suit, \u201cso I may take a better look at you.\u201d\n\nThe enderman stood up and walked closer. Then, the man in the white suit grabbed my arm and compared it to the other enderman\u2019s. His arm was like a steel bar while mine was like a noodle.\n\n\u201cNow, we shall repeat this process and make every enderman better!\u201d he said.\n\nI heard the sound of liquids rushing in and people screaming. My brethren! I ripped myself out of his grip and went dashing towards the room that held the people of Plain City.\n\nIt was too late.\n\nBy the time I got there, several rooms were filled with a green liquid and they didn\u2019t seem to be able to break free. A tear rolled down my face as guards ran up to me and tackled me to the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Chapter 8 - The Origin of Zealots\n\n\n\nError! Error! Error!\n\nAn alarm blared as the rooms got full of the liquid,\n\nError! Error! Problem X93nk2! Initiating self-destruction sequence!\n\n\u201cNooooo!\u201d cried the man in the white suit.\nHe fell to his knees clenching his suit, \u201cYou, you ruined everything!\u201d\n\nI would\u2019ve felt pretty happy if it weren\u2019t for the fact that the alarm said \u201cInitiating self-destruction sequence!\u201d I looked over and saw a blinking red light.\n\nBOOM!\n\nIn every room, there was an explosion and the force knocked everyone down. The whole facility was on fire and it was a mad dash to escape. I kicked some of the guards in the face and ran out of the building. With the sight of this scene, I cried.\n\nMy family, my friends, everyone I knew, they\u2019re all gone, killed by the explosion...\n\nSuddenly, I heard a growl. It was the man in the white suit\u2019s brother. He gripped a sword so hard I thought it might break.\n\n\u201cYou monster! You destroyed the facility, killed your town, and ruined my brother\u2019s entire career!\u201d he snarled.\n\n\u201cWhat? No that\u2019s not what happened,\u201d I said but he wasn\u2019t listening.\n\nHe slashed me with his sword. He stabbed and swung his sword like a madman. The blade grazed my arm and almost hit my shoulder as I attempted to dodge the strike. I winced in pain.\n\nI grabbed a nearby stick and attempted to block some of his attacks. The stick was broken in the process but I was able to surprise him by hurling the remains of the stick and started to climb the tree. In confusion, he climbed after me.\n\nI jumped off and landed right on him. One could agree that it was a risky move as I almost skewered myself. I knocked him off the tree and snatched his sword along the way. After making sure he was unconscious, I escaped with the sword in my hand.\n\nThis tale is perhaps, a mystery, or even a tragedy.\nAnd with that, I conclude with a farewell...\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Afterwards\n\n\n\nAnd that my friends, is the origin of zealots. I decided to name them Zealots after my friend Zeal, one of the first stolen. Those few days still haunt me to this day but I have learned that the past is the past and there is no point in groveling for my city my ENTIRE life.\n\n\n\nThank you guys for reading this story! You might've been able to catch some Easter Eggs within the story. If you didn't notice them, they are in the spoiler below.\n\n\nSpoiler: Easter Eggs\n\n\n\n1. Operation 45 6e 64 65 72 6d 61 6e is hexadecimal for Operation Enderman\n2. The two characters that we have not been told the names of are actually Minikloon and Dctr. The main hint that the 1st character was Minikloon is when the 2nd character says \"Shut your rainbow-colored mouth\" which is a nod at Minikloon's skin. The main hint for Dctr wasn't so simple. We mentioned that the 2nd character, Dctr wanted to \"sanatize\" the insects. Also, we said that he had a helmet and Dctr's minecraft skin is an astronaut with, you guessed it, a helmet."

    "body": "Disclaimer: if you're wondering about boss trading please read the entire thread as I address this issue\n\n\nDon't you love it when a huge crowd of nons in unstable crowd your broodfather and steal all the combat XP you literally just paid for\nor when someone kills the special zealot you spawned after 1500 zealot kills.\nThe list goes on and on...\n\nI sure don't. And I hope people find it annoying also\n\nThis is why I'm suggesting the completely optional \"You spawn it. You get it\" initiative. This setting, toggleable in the skyblock menu, completely prevents anyone from attacking the mob that you spawned, fished, whatever it may be. This allows you to:\n1. Secure all the drops through telekinesis which eliminates having to hope your mob was stolen near you\n2. Stops all stealing of combat XP from slayer bosses and their minibosses (probably even worse!), an issue I've seen many, many times in the spider's den. It's crazy to me how people can steal the combat XP you literally just paid for.\n3. Gives you the satisfaction of that potential rare drop jingle, whether that be from a special zealot or powerful mob.\n\nThis option will be in the settings menu of the skyblock menu. It is completely optional as people may want help with beating a t4 boss for example. And that's completely fine. However, I think this addition will give many players, like me, the independence they so long for as well as getting rid of the issues I mentioned previously\n\nThanks for reading, if you disagree please let me know your thoughts."
