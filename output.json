    "title": "Idea: Limit the Daily Playtime in Skyblock",
    "body": "Skyblock is a land void of happiness. It is full of despair, anger, sadness, addiction, and hopelessness. Every day, people waste hours upon hours of their lives sweating in Skyblock, desperately seeking anything that can get them further ahead in the game, even if it means hurting other people in the process.\n\nI think something seriously needs to happen to Skyblock in terms of allowed playtime in it. There\u2019s no way that it can keep going on the way it is without there being serious consequences to kids in real life. This addiction that most have to grinding is affecting their lives in really bad ways. Lots of them purposefully miss online classes just to partake in it. Increasing anger over stolen items, slowly developing depression from the absolute nothing that it brings to someone\u2019s emotional and mental health state, etc.\n\nMy proposal is to introduce a time limit per day for players when it comes to Skyblock. This is the only way that I can see any of this being fixed. Make no mistake, I\u2019m extremely aware of how unpopular this is gonna be to a lot of people. I realize that I will likely be called very bad names by several people for me even thinking to suggest this, but I think it\u2019s crucial that it be brought up.\n\n2 different 3 hour spans a day, Skyblock would be open to all players, 3 hours in the morning, and 3 hours in the evening/night time, to hopefully cater to multiple time zones across the world, and to also allow most kids to be able to play without interrupting their online classes, or in person classes.\n\nI think by introducing this limited playtime, it would turn into sort of a Grinch Simulator effect, where people can actually have fun in Skyblock, knowing that they only get a limited amount in it per day. I think the hostile atmosphere will be dramatically less, as you won\u2019t get anyone who\u2019s been in there the past 15 hours no sleep, and I think that it will shine the spotlight on more areas of Hypixel that most players probably might not be familiar with, like Turbo Cart Racers and Warlords, etc."

It makes it so that you can gain +50% stats from another selected sword. You can do this for any sword. For example, if a sword has 200 strength, and you reflect it onto the Speedy Sword, you gain +100 strength on the speedy sword until you switch the selected sword. It can be star-upgraded from metal essence, an essence that can be obtained in dungeons from Ooze (nice), the Woke Golem, in post-boss chests, or from salvaging metal-like weapons (not recommended)."

Placing saplings was an intended feature.\n\nUnlike Ghast Farming, which was macroable, this was not. It took effort to build the farm, plant, and destroy the trees. I see no reason for the admins to remove this as it is has pretty much the exactly the same effect as a Replenish enchanted hoe had on farming.\n\nBring back Sapling Placement.\n\nEdit: I'm going to try to spread this as much as possible so there's a bigger possibility admins can see.\nMy message to admins: Please consider reversing your shadow nerf on sapling placement, it harms more people than you think, it invalidates hours of effort. A nerf would be better received.\n\nEdit two: I'm going to add suggestions for nerfs here so that maybe admins will reconsider adding it!\n@Sir_Bacon_2020 suggested to keep it in the game, but nerf the exp gain.\n@Kashapo suggested to not nerf the exp, but instead make the saplings grow slower.\n@Athyestic suggested that the trees grow according to the Terraria rules, such as: \" There must be at least three open tiles between two Saplings or only one will grow into a tree. \" so that there are not as many trees."

Cuz people are always trying to max stuff, hence the whole \"grind for hours for +2 strength\" sorta thing.\nPlayers that join right now are going to miss out on stuff like the discounts at shops, which is a huge problem. \nI propose one of two options:\n1. Add a \"magical time table\" where you can contribute to past projects for a slightly increased cost (say like x1.2 price)\n2. After every building gets upgraded once, the 2nd upgrade to each building has the SAME bonuses as the first, and people who already did upgrades will already have their contributions. It just gives people who didnt contribute a chance to catch up. (This might be a problem where people who already contributed wouldn't help anymore, so maybe add a workaround)"

At the end of the day, it is extremely hard to prove someone irls, so please stop accusing people of it."

    "title": "[IDEA] Trading History, Deep Caverns revamp and more: 4000 words, 35+ positive reactions!",
    "body": "hi\n\n\nSpoiler: The Ancient Dragon (Quest): ~9800 symbols!\n\n\n\nMost of the Skyblock quests are pretty boring for me, and honestly, they can be way better. The point of this idea is to make major quests that are fun and balanced between mid-game and end-game players. I don't know about you, but i don't think you will have more fun oneshotting everyone in sight to finish the quest. Alright, i'm done with this. Now the idea.\n\nPart 1: Sub-Area \"Heart of the Mountain\"\nThe Heart of the Mountain is a parkour challenge accessible by going through a hidden entrance in the back of the Mountain. Upon entering it, all your stats will drop to the basics and items like Grappling Hook won't be usable. That's made so that you can't cheese it with Rabbit 6, Jump Boost 8 and Young Dragon Armor. The challenge consists of 3 parts: The caves, the underground and the core. When clearing a part, you will gain a fast travel option to where you are. That works pretty much like checkpoints. I tried my best to design the parts so that even people not used to parkour will be able to pass them, but parkour masters will go it way faster, which is fully deserved. Not like you can learn to parkour in a day.\n\nPart 1.1: The three parts\nThe three parts are very different in design, difficulty and other stuff. Here's the basics of how they look: the caves are made in mostly gray and black colors, with pretty easy parkour. The hardest jumps are a few neos, which, well, aren't even hard. The underground adds a bit of red and orange design to show you're getting closer to the core, and the parkour becomes significantly harder. It starts with a double neo, has a few neups on the way, not that bad but much harder than the caves. The core is the final challenge. Even harder than the underground, consists mostly of red and orange colors with lava flowing. There's still gray, but just a bit of it. The red and orange colors take up about 70% of the core. The parkour, too, gets harder. Although the core is by far the shortest one of the 3 parts, the jumps are really hard. Starting with a double neo, having a few neos in the way and ending with a neup after a few 4 block jumps, the core can take quite a lot of time. The area should be passed within 1hour by people average at parkour, 3 hours by people bad at it, and about 30 minutes by people really good at parkour.\n\nPart 1.2: The parkour rewards\nThe parkour isn't easy, so the rewards have to be pretty good. There are 4 things you get for completing the course, and there they are: The Mountain Core looks like a red firework core and is used in the crafting recipe for the Mountain Heart: The core in the middle, surrounded by 8 stacks of enchanted cobblestone. The Mountain Heart is an Epic accessory that grants 5 Strength, 5 Crit Chance, 10 Health and 5 Defense. The second thing is simple. 6 Fairy souls. If i'm not wrong, there are currently 209 available fairy souls in the game so these will give you 2 more possible stat boosts. Pretty solid. The third one is the main thing here, the Unstable Portal. It's a gateway to the major quest \"The Ancient Dragon\".\n\nPart 2: The Ancient Dragon quest - Story\nA long time ago, there was a clan on the territory which later becomes the place for the Village to be. Over time, it fell and only one person was still living there, Old Adventurer. Everyone else left the clan searching for better places to live. Recently, a powerful creature decided to live nearby the Old Adventurer: the Pure Dragon. Luckily, it didn't notice the old adventurer at first so he had time to hide. Living in a cave, he's safe from the dragon, but he can't really go anywhere now. There's only a little area where the dragon can't hear or see him, which became the farm he's using to provide himself with food. He managed to see how strong and merciless the dragon is, and decided to just wait in the cave until the dragon leaves the place forever. That's not happening anytime soon...\n\nPart 3: The Ancient Dragon quest - Action\nWhen you warp in through the portal, instead of warping it to the overworld (like the signs suggest) the portal warps you back in time. All your items are lost and the pure dragon is gone on a hunt. You can still go back by simply using the SB menu, and your items will be alright in the normal time. The old adventurer knows when the dragon usually comes back, and doesn't risk coming out. The dragon, obviously, only arrives once you find the place. Hints are thrown around the place showing where he is, so this shouldn't be a big problem. Once you find the Old Adventurer, you can talk to him and he will give you an old helmet, an old bow and an old sword and a map to protect yourself just in case if something goes terribly wrong. The entrance closes, so now you're stuck with him. When talking to him again, he will provide various hints that you have to find a secret passage through the wall that even he never knew about. That passage can provide a safe exit out of the village, but now the old adventurer doesn't want to leave so much. Instead, he's thinking about having revenge on the dragon since he has someone to help now. Now, the main action starts. You can collect Iron hidden around the place by going through the secret passage. There's a total of 18 Iron hidden around the map, not all of which is accessible instantly. It's used to upgrade your gear: The old helmet only has 50 HP and 50 DEF, but each stat goes up by 25 when its upgraded. Upgrades 1/2/3/ cost 1/2/3 iron respectively. The bow and sword work the same: 50 DMG and STR to start off, +25 to each stat when upgraded. the upgraded versions are called: Old, Recovered, Polished and Perfect.\nThe quest goal is to fight the Pure Dragon multiple times, each time he will go away. After fighting him for the first time by going to the top of the mountain when he's on a hunt (1:00 to 2:00 AM skyblock time) and waiting until he comes back, the map will start showing the new location of the dragon. Further fights are more simple, just come close to him and the fight starts. As he flies further, more areas and therefore more Iron is accessible. In a total of 4 fights, he goes from Home -> Forest -> Floating Islands (Jungles) -> The End. At each battle, the dragon has 10,000/20,000/30,000/100,000 HP respectively. More iron is unlocked too, with a total of 2 iron being available at the start and 3/6/9 iron being unlocked with each battle respectively. At the battle in The End, although the dragon has 100,000 HP, the Old Adventurer will instantly kill (supposedly finish) him once you've dealt 40,000 HP damage. That's a special cutscene, in which he jumps in from above and uses the Pure Chains to lock himself inside the egg in the middle of the Dragon's Nest, where the fight is happening too. As hunderds of years pass we're back in the current times, the Pure Dragon eventually dies and dissapears into the air, however out of the dust left by him, another dragon is born and starts growing... the only way to free him from the egg is by placing 12 Summoning Eyes into the altar below. Also, speaking of Pure Chains. That's an item found in a cave at the very top of the mountain, the area that unlocks when defeating the dragon for the second time. The item is required to make bridges from island to island, as there are no portals. The old adventurer gives a hint on where the Pure Chains are, saying \"I don't think we can follow the dragon to the Floating Islands... There was a storage in our clan before, but the dragon took it to where he lived before you came. There's probably nothing left, but maybe you can check it?\". When you climb, there's only gonna be the chain on top. Give it to the old adventurer, and he will say \"The chains are different from what i remember. Not sure if that's a good thing anyway.\" and take the chains. That's pretty much it.\n\nPart 4: Rewards\nI'm writing this a bit later than the eariler parts and i'm sorry if something doesn't match with what i said before.\nTo the rewards. The quest itself is really long and big, so the rewards are huge as well.\nThe first reward is Pure Scale and it's a drop from the final Pure Dragon bossfight. It's one of the two items that can be transfered from the past to the normal skyblock world. If your inventory is full as you get in the normal world with a Pure Scale, it will be in your stash. So, what does it do? You can combine it with a Summoning Eye in a crafting table to get an Awakened Eye. Then, you can place the A. Eye in one single middle frame of the altar. Once it's placed, the Pure Dragon will appear. It has 15M health and can use all of the attacks used by normal dragons. For the single person who placed the eye, it will always drop 2 or 3 Pure fragments to the person who placed it and 3-4 random fragments to people who simply damaged it. The chances of getting a specific type of a fragment are the same as getting a specific type of a dragon (4% for Superior and 16% for everything else). Out of the Pure fragments, the Pure Dragon armor can be made using the classic dragon armor recipe. The PD armor has the stats of Unstable with 100 more defense for each piece, HOWEVER its full set bonus grants you all of the dragon armor effects expect for the Superior and Holy effects, their bonuses are nerfed to 1.7% regen speed and 3% stat boosts. I'm honestly not sure about this one, it should probably be buffed and nerfed a lot of times.\nThe second reward, as if the PD armor wasn't enough, is an epic accessory called \"A Relic from the Past\". the Old Adventurer will give you the accessory after defeating the PD for the last time as a gift. It's also one of the two items that can be transfered to the normal world. The effect is pretty simple: All the reforges applied have their negative effects removed, and the positive effects are buffed by 1.5%.\n\nPart 5: Afterwords\nHonestly, i think this area can be used for more quests or bossfights. Not sure about that though.\nI've spent a few days working on this, and the only problems i currently see with this is the quest being so large it can't be added because of that.\nIf you have any ideas to improve this one, please tell them in the replies! Bumps are always appreciated, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Trading History (Menu option): ~3000 symbols!\n\n\n\nThis idea is basically what the name suggests. It's pretty simple, but i'm gonna try to explain this in details.\nThe trading history option is located in the top left corner of the menu and looks like a diamond.\n\nPart 1: Design\nThe sides are covered with black glass panels, as a lot of other menu parts in Skyblock. The history itself is shown in a lot of heads sorted by whatever you want it to be sorted by. The options are Newest first, oldest first and biggest first (amount of different items in trade). When you hover over a head, it shows what the trade was like. Example below:\n\n\nSpoiler: Trade details\n\n\n\nTrade with Player\n+100,000 coins\n-Leather Boots (Colored: #9300D3)\nTrade completed: September 11, 2001\nID: ba23-jA3-nNMj6y\n\n\nNotice that \"ID\" part in trade details? It's made to look up trades. At the top right part of the history, there's a \"Find trades\" sign. Click on it, and a sign will show up in which you can type in a trade ID which you probably got from your friend or a scam rage thread. The ID will also show in the bottom of the chat message after completing a trade. Also, it's possible to disable the possibility to look up your trades or in the API settings (or set it to semi-private like \"friends only\").\n\nPart 2: Trade settings\nTrade settings is a mini option located in the top left corner of the history and seen as redstone dust. The option is pretty much what the name suggest, but like everything here, i'm gonna try to explain it in details. Here's a list of things you can change:\n\n\nSpoiler: Possible options in settings\n\n\n\n-Trade confirmation time: No confirmation, 3s (classic), 5s, 10s\n-Auto-stack items added into trade: Yes, no (classic)\n-Blacklist players from trading with you: (add players manually)\n-Reset sent items to their normal forms (e.g dyed leather armor becomes undyed, and changed name to \"Leather Boots (Colored #9300D3)\"): Yes, no\nand more i didn't think of\n\n\n\nPart 3: Counter-trading?\nI'm really not sure about this one. It can be easily bad, but i'm still gonna put this here.\nClicking on a head in the history allows to send them a counter-trade, even if they're not online. In it, you can choose things from both yours and theirs inventory. They can accept it by seeing a message about a trade being sent in their chat and then accepting/declining by doing the same thing as you did to send. If they were offline when you sent the counter-trade, the message will appear as soon as they join Skyblock. I'm not sure about this at all because offline trading is something absolutely new and is not how trades work and were working since the release of SB.\n\nPart 4: Afterwords\nThis idea is fairly simple and short.\nI see it being useful for sending proofs that you've been scammed primarly, but there's so much more ways this can be used.\nThis one, too, is pretty incomplete. I feel like a lot more can be added to this one, so please tell your suggestions in replies if you want to.\nAgain, bumps are always appreciated. Thank you for reading!\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Deep Caverns Revamp (Revamp): ~9000 symbols!\n\n\n\nThe deep caverns, are, well... deep caverns. You're leaving this area extremely early and probably not coming back expect for getting fairy souls. This revamp should make the Deep Caverns more useful to mid-game and late-game players.\n\nPart 1: Sub-Area: \"The Abyss\"\nThe name probably isn't very original. Maybe i'll change it later.\nThe Abyss is the deepest area accessible in the deep caverns, and is not accessible like the other areas by simply going down or using the lift. None of these will work with The Abyss. Instead, you must find a deep hole in the Obsidian Sanctuary and drop down in the horizontal portal you can't see. There's no level requirement to get down there, but only a small area with monsters as strong as the Obsidian Sanctuary ones can be explored. The rest is blocked by the Lift Operator saying \"You're still very weak to go there... Just like myself. Maybe you should come back when your Combat skill reaches 15? Once you're strong enough, i'll let you pass.\". As you can see from the dialogue, you need Combat 15 to explore the rest of the Abyss because of the strong mobes on the other side. Also, forgot to mention. The Abyss, unlike other Deep Caverns sub-areas, doesn't go down. Instead, it goes to the all the sides and just a little bit up (about 15 blocks difference from the lowest and highest points).\n\nPart 1.1: Monsters of the Abyss\nThe monsters are, well, strong. You already know that anyways. I'll just list the mobs here.\n\nLiving Void: Zombie with 25,000 health. Has leather armor dyed black. The classic monster in the Abyss, met fairy often.\nPalace Guard: Skeleton with 35,000 health. Just like Living Void, has black leather armor. You start noticing them as you go to the right, where the Gray Palace is located. They start appearing rarely, but as you go closer to the Gray Palace, they will be appearing more often.\nOld Guard: Zombie with 40,000 health. Has iron armor. As you walk into the Gray Palace, Palace Guards are replaced by Old Guards. which move 20% faster than the easier mobs in the Abyss.\nTo the mob drops. Living Void drops from 2 to 10 Rotten Flesh, as well as Enchanted Obsidian with a 5% chance.\nPalace Guards drop from 2 to 10 bones, as well as a random piece of Golem Armor with a 1% chance.\nOld Guards drop from 5 to 15 Rotten Flesh, as well as an Empty Artifact with a 1% chance.\nEmpty Artifact can be used at the Altar in the Gray Palace to speed up the time left until Intelligent Emptiness spawns by 20 minutes. Also, speaking of Intelligent Emptiness...\n\nPart 1.2: Intelligent Emptiness\nIntelligent Emptiness is the boss in the Abyss, an ender dragon. It spawns every 2 hours in the Gray Palace. When it spawns, all the Old Guards will despawn. The boss has 20M HP, which is quite a lot. And it becomes even more, because all the damage higher than 125,000 only deals 100,000.\nThe attacks, unlike others, deal a % of your current HP instead of an amount of damage. The attacks are: Rush - The boss rushes at a random player, dealing 40% of your their health. Meteor - A warning comes in chat. 3 seconds after, a meteor falls on every player from the sky dealing 25% of their max health. Meteors fall slowly, so you have time to avoid them. Rage - Activates at 50% health and lasts for the rests of the fight. Meteors fall 25% faster and rush deals 50% of a player's current health instead of 40%. Call - A lot of Living Void starts spawning right outside of the bossfight room and come towards the players. Call happens at 25% health and lasts for 10 seconds spawning 2 LV per second, for a total of 20 Living Voids. Final Blow - The Intelligent Emptiness blows up 5 seconds after death, instakilling everyone who came in range. This attack is very unlikely to hurt anyone, as death will probably happen high up in the air.\nThe drops are pretty decent. The I.E always drops 1-50 obsidian, 1-10 ench. obsidian and 1-3 \"Parts of Emptiness\". RNG drops, of course, exist. Did you think we're not in skyblock? The boss drops a random piece of Void Armor with a 5% chance, or 20% chance for those who got in the Top 3 of damage leaderboards shown at the end of the battle. All the Void Armor pieces have the same stats:\n\nPart 1.3: Void Armor statistics\nVoid Armor is leather armor dyed gray. The statistics are:\nOne Piece | Full Set\n+210 Health | 840 Health\n+120 Defense |480 Defense\n+20 Strength | 80 Strength\n+5 Speed | 20 Speed\n+2 Crit Chance | 8 Crit Chance\nIt also has a neat Full Set Bonus: Void Creature - This set of armor makes you a shade, making mobs notice you only when you're 2.8 blocks near them. Hitting a mob with a sword when invisible deals 50% more damage, but only works once on a single monster. Once the ability is used up, the same monster will see you in their normal range.\n\nPart 1.4: The Abyss design\nThe Abyss is made mostly in gray and light gray colors, with a bit of black. There's no ceiling in this area, and all the action happens on small islands located about 2 blocks between each other. Falling in between small islands causes death. The Gray Palace, however, is made in 50/50 white and gray colors, with pillars and more. It has a few large rooms, and a huge throne room. Above the big throne, the Intelligent Emptiness spawns every 2 hours. Behind the throne, there's a small altar in which Empty Artifacts can be thrown to speed up the wait by 20 minutes.\n\nPart 1.5: The Abyss ores\nAs i was writing this, i kinda forgot the Abyss is still in the Deep Caverns which is a mining area. So, well. I guess i'll just put it here now.\nThere are all types of ores in the abyss. Like, every single ore. They appear on the small islands, in the floor or sometimes below it. Ores there require the Telekinesis enchant to get. Also, they have a 3% chance to give their enchanted form, and a 0.005% chance to drop their enchanted block form. Quartz can also be found in the Abyss. Yes, i do know about BouncySeal's \"The Void\" thread. Yes, i know it's similar.\n\nPart 2: The Late-Game Expansion\nEveryone knows how useless Deep Caverns are for late-game players. This part is about making the Deep Caverns something a late-game player will go into. So, let's start with the ores. One of the main purposes Deep Caverns have is getting 50 ores for a minion, which makes you completely forget about the Deep Caverns. That's one of the main things why nobody goes here, this place is literally useless because of how slowly it provides materials. How to fix that? As you progress, you unlock more features. The Mining skill is one of the main things Deep Caverns would use to see that.\nAt Mining 15, the ores will now have a 1/50 chance to give their enchanted form.\nAt Mining 25, the ores will have a 1/150 chance to drop their enchanted block form.\nAt Mining 30, more areas will be available. I'll get to that in detail a bit later.\nFinally, at mining 40, something very interesting happens... I'll get to that later.\n\nPart 2.1: New NPC: \"Masterful Miner\"\nThe Masterful Miner is a new NPC found near the main stairs leading to the Deep Caverns. He is mainly used to provide rewards for achievements in mining. Here's a list of rewards:\nMining 10: 5 Enchanted Diamonds\nMining 15: \"Magical Blade\" Enchantment Book recipe\n\n\nSpoiler: \"Magical Blade\" Pickaxe enchantment\n\n\n\nMagical Blade can only be crafted, you can't find it at the Enchanting Table. Its recipe is simple: 1 Ench. Diamonds at each corner (total of 4), 4 enchanted gold at each side (total of 16) and a book in the middle. Magical Blade I gives a bonus 0.4% chance to mine up an enchanted form of an ore. Each level grants a bonus 0.4%, resulting in a maximum 2% bonus chance with Magical Blade V.\n\n\nMining 20: 750,000 coins\nMining 30: 1M coins, Access to hidden areas\nMining 35: 1M coins, \"Pure\" reforge stone\n\n\nSpoiler: \"Clean\" Pickaxe Reforge\n\n\n\nClean is a reforge for pickaxes, granting 5 Defense. It also has a reforge bonus: Get a 10% chance to get triple ore drops. This also applies to enchanted block drops, giving you 3 enchanted blocks with an extremely low chance.\n\n\nMining 40: 5M coins, access to more hidden areas\n\nPart 2.2: Hidden areas\nThere are hidden areas in every Deep Caverns level. They aren't a\u0441tually \"hidden\", instead, they're only accessible with the Lift Operator once you gain permission from the Masterful Miner. The ones accessible from Mining 30 contain: Huge amount of ores, stronger mobs dropping the enchanted version of what the normal mobs of their type dropped (Sronger Lapis Zombies have 5000 Health and drop enchanted rotten flesh, stronger slimes have 2000 to 7000 health and drop enchanted slime). The hidden areas accessible from Mining 40 contain: stronger mobs; even more ores; block versions of normal ores (these also drop their enchanted block versions 20% more often than normal ores), enchanted ores (these ores also drop a random amount of coins when mined, between 1000 and 15000).\n\nPart 3: Afterwords\nWhew, that was a long one. Hope you liked it.\nHonestly, i feel like that's the worst one out of the three. As always, if you have any ideas to improve this one, please do write them in replies.\nAnd yet again, bumps are always appreciated! I spent so much time on this thread...\n\n\n\nFinally, it's done. I will be adding more ideas in future updates, i really like torturing myself i guess. Please do bump this or i will do it myself. It will take me a long amount of time to accept that this thread died. Also, i'm not really good at making ideas honestly. This might be bad.\nI really need feedback for this one, so please take your time to select one part and read it. Again, i really need feedback. I've spent a lot of time on this and i really want to see how did it turn out. Bumps are highly appreciated, too."

    "title": "[IDEA] A New Talisman For More Inventory Managment!",
    "body": "Hi! So, recently I had an idea for a new talisman that will automatically delete an item or items from your inventory. I know people have probably mentioned this before, but I think my idea will be original.\n\nThis new talisman comes in 3 tiers, (Just like the personal compacter) It will have the Vacuum Cleaner the uncommon version, the Vacuum Cleanser, the rare version, and the Vacuum Purifier, the Epic version. Here are some screenshots of each one. (Ignore the redstone tag)\nI didn't include this in the screenshots but each version of the talisman is a Hopper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are these items made?\nSo, I was thinking that this item could be made with something that can be obtained through a mob in f9, or from a chest after slaying Storm.\nThis new item would just be called Wind.\nWind would be used in each crafting recipe for each tier. Here are some screenshots of the recipes and a screenshot of the new Wind item. (The iron amount can be modified)\nP.s. I know some of my screenshots are kinda messed up right now, but this is my first idea thread, so please bare with me. (Just pretend there's a hopper in the crafting slot.)\n\nThe new Wind item. (Ignore the Materials tag)\n\n\n\n\nAnd now here are the recipes.\nThe Vacuum Cleaner Recipe. ( 160 enchanted iron and one Wind.)\n\n\n\n\nThe Vacuum Cleanser Recipe. (5 enchanted iron blocks, 1 Wind, and 1 Vacuum Cleaner.)\n\n\n\n\nThe Vacuum Purifier Recipe. ( 15 enchanted iron blocks, 1 Wind, and 1 Vacuum Cleanser.)\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it work?\nSo, I haven't really explained how this works yet. This item will be like the Personal Compacter. The Uncommon version will have one slot for the item you want to be automatically deleted, the Rare version will have 3, and the Epic version will have 5. This talisman will delete an item automatically from your inventory if you have it selected in the talisman configuration. This idea came to my head when I was foraging on my island with the new tree farm you can make. I was often having to deal with saplings and apples in my inventory because they had the habit of not stacking, and would just fill up my inventory. With this new talisman, you'd be able to just have those get sold directly to the npc for their normal price. If you put an item that can be sold to bazaar in the talisman, it will be sold to the bazaar when deleted from your inventory.\nSwords, armor, accessories, tools, and other things like that can not be put in the talisman configuration. You can only put things in that can be sold to the bazaar, or blocks that can not be sold to the bazaar but will be sold to the npc.\n\nWill this have any dupe glitches?\nThis should not have dupe glitches, as it will use the same function for putting items in the configuration as the Personal Compacter. And there have been no dupe glitches with the Personal Compacter.\n\nUnfortunately, this would not be released till the floor 9 update if admins thought it was a good item, as it requires a new item from floor 9 to craft it.\nBut it kinda makes sense to introduce a new Vacuum talisman with a boss called Storm.\n\nPlease tell me if you think anything should be modified in this!\n(Edit: With items that can be sold at bazaar, I think that they would just go through an instant sell, and not a sell offer. I think that'd break the game a bit, if you and 10000 other people were making a sell offer every 5 seconds.)"

    "body": "Hello, as you may know menacing banana is a youtuber that makes hypixel skyblock related content, and in this post i will be going over WHY he shouldn't be overly hated for the things that he had done. Now we need to know HE SHOULDN'T BE LOOKED AT LIKE AN ANGEL. HE DID WRONG AND HE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIS \"CRIMES\" Anyway let's talk about the first problem.\n\n1 . People overly insulting him for his crimes.\n\nOne of the most popular skyblock youtubers called akinsoft made a youtube video with him explaining why menacing banana is a total bag of rice stealing people's ideas, scamming partners etc. Now he is about 50% right in his video, HE DID OVERREACT TO SOME OF THE THINGS HE HAS DONE.\nAnd the hate he has gotten from the skyblock community\nis awful. For example he already got doxxed. YES, DOXXED which is an actual crime. And, he did apologize to the people he scammed the money from GAVE IT BACK, and lego maestro's newest post was this :\n\n\" Just had a very emotional interview with Menacing Banana, he broke down and was sorry about what he did.\"\n\nReally, people who overly want to hurt him should know that he, menacing banana. Is an actual human being that actually could kill himself, in his discord he told me that he had an actual panic attack so please do not send him more hate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The agroMC situation\n\nMenacing banana actually bodyshamed a youtuber called agroMc and told him that his channel was dead in a private discord call.\nHe acted like a total manchild and wasn't a nice person to be around, and well. That's a really bad thing. Still the hate is too much. But you shouldn't consider menacing as a total angel because he is not one himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The PvpWars Drama\n\nMenacing banana actually scammed his partners a few months ago, it was a bad move that he did, he got bored with that server and didn't record the 2 more videos he promised he would, now let's talk about his actual apologize for his behavour.\n\nIn his newest video he wrote a comment under with his apology and sent a tweet on twitter, which was a good thing that he did, now for the 2nd time or even 3rd time. He did return the money, and it wasn't actually 5000 dollars, it was 2000 dollars and akinsoft actually faked that one.\nThe owners of the network said they were fine because he returned the money and the issue was resolved\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitLonger \u2014 When you talk too much for Twitter\n\n\nTwitLonger is the easy way to post more than 140 characters to Twitter\n\n\n\n\nwww.twitlonger.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, please don't be a dick and hate on him, but yes he understand why people hate on him and listen, he is trying to actually fix his behaviour\nand now, is in one of the worst spots to be in.\n\n\n https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1325526662054862850\n\n https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1325526659139858438\n\ngoodbye, if you found this useful you may actually give me a reaction or something, but i don't want to farm them with my post. Because it would be a bad thing, right? If you have anymore questions feel free to actually message me here, i'll be active (probably)"

    "body": "It's bad by not having a set amount of resources collected, just like the Halloween even, to reach bronze, silver or gold level. Let me explain why:\n\nStarting out with the new update, all buffs you can have are 100% triple crops(300%) but only if you're farming 50, a hoe with Harvesting 5 which grants 62.5% and a legendary elephant pet for +50% = 412.5%. And how likely is it to be farming 50 and own a leg. elephant? Not really as someone who doesn't play 24/7.\n\nThis puts you in a disadvantage with people who already have the new hoes/axes for more crop drops. They have an easier time to get to gold than you do. This will also help them get every hoe to the 3rd tier and receive +50% for their respective crops.\nThe rich get richer and the poor get poorer."

You must have some serious brain damage if you think fish minions make you stonks?\". Nowhere in that sentence am I discriminating against a certain group of people. And before people say it's the part where I say he/she has brain damage, I am not discriminating against people with brain damage. Nowhere in that sentence do I say that people with brain damage are babies or something, I'm saying that the person must have brain damage.\nA bit of context: Some guy posted a thread where he was asking why people thought that fishing minions were bad. I responded saying that fishing minions with no super compactors fill up too quickly, and that person couldn't get on every 3 hours to collect their minions, so fishing minions would suck for money. This person then continues to say that from his \"experience\" tier 4 fishing minions make more than tier 5 lapis minions. That's kinda the reason I got so mad, he legit wan't listening to anything anyone said.\nIf any mods read this post, I think that a lot of the \"discrimination\" bans are not actually real. I have heard and seen screenshots of people getting banned for \"discrimination\" for really dumb reasons. In my case, i'm assuming that the mod just saw the words \"brain damage\" and banned me for discrimination. I'm not trying to say that the Hypixel forums mods are terrible, but they definitely need to read posts a bit clearer so these dumb bans don't keep happening.\n\ntl;dr: \"discrimination\" bans on the forums are very random a lot of the time, and mods need to read our posts more carefully.\n\nSkyblock related: While I was banned, I decided to continue my scammer thread, where I try and dumb scammers.\nSo the one I did this time was a MVP+ with endgame gear, and this kinda surprised me, I don't think anyone would be dumb enough to try to scam people and risk losing billions of coins and IRL money. The even dumber part was that he only tried to scam me out of 1.5 mil, which he could probably make in 1 hour. So I ask in the hubs for someone selling a hoe of greater tilling and I get partied by this person. I check his sky.lea.moe and his api is on, but then I refresh the website and than its off. I already knew it was a scam because I had seen the diamond hoe in his inventory that he was gonna use to scam me. Then he does the backpack scam, leaves the party, and ignore adds me.\nThis is one of the dumbest scammers I have ever met. The fact that an MVP+ endgame player is trying to scam 1.5 mil from me. He is legit risking a bunch of coins and IRL money to get 1.5 mil.\nFirst Scammer Test: https://hypixel.net/threads/poll-scam-trials-1.3408881/\nTell me if you want me to continue doing this, and any scammers you want me to test.\n\nEdit: Please actually read my post, people keep saying i'm \"ban evading\" or my \"scam reports won't go through\" even though that wasn't the point of this post."

    "title": "Inflation 2.0 ?",
    "body": "One of the main reason that inflation happen is minion, as it generate stuff over time and selling it to npc gives more coin to the economy, thus inflation(just an example), with the new farming contest update, it encourage people to actively harvest their large scale farm, generating many item at a rate much faster then before. with price of E pumpkin drop below 640(npc sell price) player is more likely to sell their crops to npc. A silver medal(from my past 3 contest) is about minimum 32k pumpkin harvested , that is about 128k coin added per person, not to mention that gold medal is about 81k pumpkin harvested, which is 324k per person. assuming only 5k of the player join each pumpkin contest and each person only earn the lowest of their rank and on average 7 pumpkin contest were held. That is an addition 1.967 Billion coin added per day just with by pumpkin contest, about 70% of daily snow and cyan minion and number is very likely to be higher as many player harvested much more pumpkin in between ranks. what do u guys think?

It's only 50k! I can get that in 2 minutes! How will that help them???\" \nto my response, I say yes, some endgame players sure can get that much money or even more in 2 minutes. But, I didn't do this \"experiment\" to just help out random people, I wanted to see how much of the early game community cared about others. \n\nAnd so, the Tl;dr is there are still kind people out there and are very grateful you are helping them.

So wonderfull in fact that I think that the creators of skyblock should take inspiration from some of the AMAZING ideas the creators of fortnite have had. This is one of my best suggestions and possibly could make it in the game with a good amount of tweaking. I noticed that fortnite added this amazing dog skin\n\n\n\n\nI believe that something similar to this can be added in skyblock. Currently there is a dog armor set but there are not nearly enough furries in the game. This means that the furry community is not represented well. I also see that soviet aspects of the game are not flaunted enough and that there should be more soviet aspects. For this, I suggest a new npc with challenges:\nSoviet doge npc (embrace the furry side)\n\nThis npc would have 3 challenges and reward you with a furry talismen that covers your screen in furries once every 3 minutes. Here are the three challenges\n\nLapdog:\nDonate 40m to a youtuber mod or helper without anything in return\n\n\nFollower\nFollow a player withing 3 blocks for 1 hour\n\n\nSocialism\nGive 15 begging nons exactly what they ask.\n\nI think that I should get creative mind for this.

I'm concerned if sentences like the skill average one isn't a dead giveaway something is a joke to you.\n\nIts all just grinding. Who tf wants to spend hours of their life on this game. This game is a waste of time. Look at wynncraft, you don't have to grind at all, you just enjoy it. This is what skyblock should be. Anyone with a skill average past 10 is a no life with no friends who probably fails all their classes, probably gonna be lonely forever. Stop playing this game and find something better to do."

    "body": "I want to first specify that this is specifically 1.17. Supposedly, the combat system changed back or something idk if not then ignore me cos 1.8 combat mechanics are wayyy better for skyblock. \n\n\nObviously server stability is gonna play a huge part in hypixel updating versions in general. It's just easier for Hypixel to run on 1.8 (I think it's on 1.8.2), they didn't change to 1.9 to keep the more competetive side of pvp and they have run that way for ages. But 1.17 might actually be good\n\nLoads of new blocks to build new islands and **** with. New mobs, netherite could be used for sets. If the combat systems are the same, the only reasons i see not to update are this:\n\nPeople like and are used to playing on 1.8\nServer stability\n\nBut yeh, I'm sure a lot of people will know more about this then me and will probably make me look dumb but if not then it could potentially be converted to 1.17?"

I dont know the names of the channels or servers, its been a while.\n\nAny user may use real money to buy skyblock gems on the hypixel store, currently $4.99 for 675 gems (which I purchased about 2 hours ago) as the lowest priced and least economical option.\n\nAny item bought with skyblock gems can be traded for in game coins, excluding those that are direct buffs to the player rather than through the consumption of an item. I discovered this after opening the bazaar before writing this and seeing 2.2mil appearing in quick sell, and wondering how 5 stacks of enchanted birch could be sold for that much.\n\nWhat do I make of this?\n\nHonestly, I feel let down by hypixel. They've been amazingly vigilant about trading various in-game items and currency for real money, and I respect that. However now it seems that they're doing it themselves. For the price of 25 bucks, you can get yourself a pigman sword and a set of superior if you target the auction house right. And if you don't, well you can eat a month of booster cookies, collect all your bits, buy stonks, and resell them with compacting X enchants on them, again raking in a decent price and boosting your XP. Not to mention the several hundred enchanted items you could sell. Way less than straight selling the cookies, but you're still opened up to the potential of in-game currency as a result of spending real money.\nI'd like to see something put in place to change this. I think that non-paying players should absolutely be able to access booster cookies in exchange for in-game effort, but maybe we should implement some way to get gems for free that doesn't involve near impossibility (if there is let me know)."

    "body": "Skyblock Stock Brokers\nThe BEST tool to making millions of coins on the bazaar WITHOUT ANY EFFORT\nOVER 2000 POSITIVE REVIEWS\n\n\nWe've done it. We hit an outstanding 10000+ members in just one week. For those not familiar with our bots, I have designed a set of a couple discord bots that track the bazaar 24/7. These bots watch crashes, crafts, flips, and use complicated algorithms to give you the best investments to do so you can make millions of coins, even without any prior bazaar flipping knowledge. Details about the bots are below.\n\n\n\nARE THESE BOTS EVEN LEGAL?\nYes, these bots are completely legal. I use the API provided by Hypixel themselves to do analysis on the bazaar. Since there\nare no ingame modifications, there is no danger of trouble using these bots.\n\n\nSpoiler: MINIKLOON APPROVED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd without further ado, let me introduce the bots that will be making you rich\n\nPERSONAL BAZAAR BOT:\n\nTruly my ultimate pride and joy, you simply input the amount of money you want to put into the bazaar, and it comes up with your own PERSONALIZED investment strategy on how to make the most amount of profit from your capital. This bot requires no thinking whatsoever, and you can rest easy knowing the strategy that it comes up for you will use its advanced algorithm to make sure you are making the most amount of money possible. Additionally, since it factors in demand, it expects all the orders to be filled within 5-10 minutes. It also flags volatile items and filters out unprofitable ones, so that it is made sure you don't lose money! This means you are making each cycle of profit within 5-10 minutes. You can do the math yourself on how much that would make you an hour.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Example of Personal Bazaar Bot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFLIP BOT:\n\nDo you want to do the investing yourself? Are you a more advanced trader looking for the best flips out there? Say no more, as this bot ranks the top ten flips (buy order -> sell order) by both profit per flip possible, and profit percent (the amount of profit divided by the price of the flip, so you get the most bang for your buck). This list scans every item in the bazaar, and updates every 30 seconds.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Example of Flip Bot\n\n\n\nRanked by Profit:\n\n\n\n\nRanked by Profit Percent:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRAFT BOT:\n\nOne of the most profitable things you can do on the bazaar is buy items, craft them into some sort of product, and then sell that product. The hard part is finding which crafts are profitable, as that takes a lot of calculations. This bot scans every craft possible in the bazaar (there are over 100!), and then ranks them in the same format as the flip bot (by profit and profit percent). This bot assumes you are setting buy orders for that item, and then insta-selling the product (no risk involved). Also updates every 30 seconds.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Example of Craft Bot\n\n\n\nRanked by Profit:\n\n\n\n\nRanked by Profit Percent:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRASH BOT:\n\nThis bot is constantly analyzing the bazaar, and it reports any crashes in item prices. It will report both buy and sell order crashes. This is highly profitable as if you are one of the first to react to some sort of crash, you can get that item for insanely cheap prices and sell it for MASSIVE profits. In a single day, there are DOZENS of crashes, each with their own potential to make huge amounts of coins for relatively low investments.\n\n\n\nSpoiler: Example of Crash Bot\n\n\n\nBuy Order Crash:\n\n\n\n\nSell Order Crash:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN SUMMARY:\n\nThere is a lot of money to be made with these bots. You can be the first to react to a crash on the bazaar, and make millions of coins in mere minutes. You can do your own analysis with the flip bot, or find easy money profits with the craft bot. If you just want to make money and not think at all, simply use the personal bot and it will tell you exactly what to do.\n\nThe best part? You don't ever have to rely on anyone else to make this money. No giving your coins to someone else, no relying on pings, no chance of a sca\u200em. These bots will always be up, day or night, so that you can make massive amounts of money from the bazaar. This is all allowed and legal, as I am simply doing calculations with the information that Hypixel themselves provide.\n\nUnfortunately because of high server costs and bot fees, we do have to charge a slight fee for full access to our bots (minikloon approved again btw, check our discord for screenshot proof). This is just to help keep the bots running on the server, as I am a broke college student and I can't afford the monthly payments myself. Don't want to pay? No problem! There are tons of ways you can get full access to our bots for free.\n\nWe give a free 30 minute trial, and another 12 hours of free usage if you leave a review on how you felt about the bot (can be good or bad, we don't care!). If you still want to use the bot after that, but can't pay, we give you free access to it simply by being active and talking! As you talk more in the discord channels, your rank increases, and eventually you can have full access to all of our bots without paying!\n\nStart making your millions today. Don't believe me? Come join our discord, and find out yourself.\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler\n\n\n\nhttps://discord.gg/2mzkatJ\n\n\n\n\ntl:dr - Use this bot to bazaar flip, go buy yourself a Superior Armor Set and Enderdragon Pet\n\n\u200b"

My reasoning for this is because regular profiles have such a big advantage over iron man profiles in the case that they can buy cookies and use bits, which means that they can acually get the builders wand and build a big farm way faster than an iron man profile would ever be able to, even with the edition of the new items and they can get better and better stuff just for being in late game already like the addition of being able to become farming level 60 and you know what that means more crops and an easier time getting gold all the time, meanwhile iron man profiles have no chance to become farming level 60 since you have to earn a gold medal to actually get the increased level cap. I could state a lot more reasons but I'll just leave it at this and hope you understand what I'm trying to say.\n\n\nTLDR: Regular profiles and iron man profiles farming contests should be separated ."
